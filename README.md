                         DESPICABLE ME 2



                           Written by

                     Cinco Paul & Ken Daurio





   EXT: ARCTIC CIRCLE - DAY

   Snow and ice as far as the eye can see. What looks like a
   windowless MILITARY BASE surrounded by barbed wire fences
   sits in the middle of the wasteland.

   TITLE CARD: TOP SECRET RESEARCH LABORATORY.   ARCTIC CIRCLE.

   At the GUARD GATE, two RUSSIAN GUARDS play poker using an
   overturned barrel as a table.

   Russian Guard 1 shows a five of diamonds... and four Aces.
   The other Guard folds. Russian Guard 1 LAUGHS and drags in
   the pile of coins.

   While he SPEAKS IN RUSSIAN and does a celebratory dance, the
   coins fly up into the air. Russian Guard 1 stops dancing and
   sees that the coins are gone. He accuses the other Guard of
   stealing them. Russian Guard 2 swears he didn't take them.

   Russian Guard 1 grabs a shovel and wields it menacingly,
   until it flies up into the air. They both look up to see
   where it's gone. Then the metal barrel they were using as a
   table flies up, knocking them over.

   Russian Guard 2 looks up to see a GIGANTIC MAGNET SHIP
   LOWERING DOWN FROM ABOVE AND HOVERING OVER THE LABORATORY.

   A watchtower guard shouts. A door below opens as a bunch of
   Guards run out and point their guns at the magnet ship.
   Then...WOOSH! All of their guns are pulled up towards the
   ship, including the guards themselves, who are strapped to
   their guns.

   A SNOWMOBILE lifts off the ground and flies up to the magnet.
   Other vehicles and small buildings begin to pull away from
   the ground.

   Then--

   THE ENTIRE LAB STARTS TO GET PULLED UP OUT OF THE GROUND.

   CLANK! The lab makes contact with the ship. It flies up and
   down, shaking the scientists and guards off. They fall to
   the ground. The magnet ship flies away with their lab,
   vehicles, and weapons.

   The remaining guards and scientists are strewn across the
   snow with the remnants of the damaged base. We see a porta-
   potty door open. A Confused Guard is sitting on the can
   reading a newspaper, having missed the entire incident. He
   closes the door.

                                              MATCH CUT TO:
          DESPICABLE ME 2            CINCO & KEN DRAFT   2.


   INT: AVL HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT

   SECURITY FOOTAGE of the research station named PX LABS being
   carried away by the magnet ship plays on the screens at AVL
   Headquarters.

   We see the back of several heads watching the footage.

   There's a heavy sigh.

                    SILAS
          Three weeks and we're still no
          closer to cracking this?

No response.

                    SILAS (CONT'D)
          Right... bring him in.

                      LUCY (O.S.)
          Yes, sir.


EXT: SUBURBAN STREET - DAY

Gru steps toward camera, holding some sort of menacing gun,
which he loads and cocks. He pulls the trigger, which shoots
out an inflatable unicorn balloon.

Smiling, he ties it to the windowsill next to some others.



EXT: GRU'S BACKYARD - DAY

A banner reads: "Happy Birthday Agnes!" and a massive
backyard party is in full swing. The yard is decorated with
pink balloons and streamers, and a BOUNCY HOUSE shaped like a
castle.

AGNES and several other LITTLE GIRLS slide down a slide.
They are all dressed as princesses, but Agnes is dressed as a
princess riding a unicorn.

                    AGNES
          This is the best party EVER!!!

Edith, dressed as a ninja, emerges from beneath a table and
climbs across the monkey bars as a series of jousts, blades,
and boxing gloves come up from the ground underneath her.
She jumps down, narrowly avoiding a bear trap.

                     EDITH
          Haha!   Yeah!
          DESPICABLE ME 2           CINCO & KEN DRAFT       3.


Two LITTLE GIRLS fish in a small kiddie pool. One of the
girls pulls up a toy duck and then razzes the other girl, but
then a LIVE PIRANHA jumps out and eats the toy duck.

A BOY and a GIRL sword fight. The Boy does a bunch of fancy
moves. The Girl waits for him to finish and then pounds him
on the head with a club.

Two kids in the background are on a see-saw made of bombs.
Agnes runs into the middle of the yard and points offscreen.

                     AGNES
          Oh no!   A dragon is approaching!

All of the kids turn and see KYLE dressed as a dragon. He
GRUMBLES and then they SCREAM and huddle around Agnes. Then
Margo enters wearing a SUIT OF ARMOR and wielding a SWORD.

                    MARGO
          Fear not, for here come the gallant
          knights to save us!

She gestures to a group of minions wearing tiny suits of
armor and wielding various MEDIEVAL WEAPONS. The Kids CHEER
as the minions charge toward Kyle. One accidentally hits
another with his sword. A fight ensues in which they use the
medieval weapons on each other.

One minion pounds another with a MACE. One Minion wanders off
from the fight with his helmet on backwards, wildly swinging
his mace.

Across the yard, Gru is busy grilling burgers and talking on
the phone. Not happy.

                    GRU
          No, no, no! What do you mean she's
          not coming?! I have a backyard
          full of these little girls who are
          counting on a visit from a fairy
          princess!

The mace-swinging Minion walks by and accidently, repeatedly
hits Gru with the mace in the shin.

                     GRU (CONT'D)
          Ah!   Hurts! Ah! Stop it!

Gru kicks the minion's helmet and chases him off with a
spatula, sending him towards the party swinging his mace.
Gru SIGHS and returns to the call.
          DESPICABLE ME 2              CINCO & KEN DRAFT   4.


                    GRU (CONT'D)
          Listen! I don't want a refund! I
          want a fairy princess... please!
          Please, I am begging you.
              (Resigned)
          You know what? I hope that you can
          sleep at night, you crusher of
          little girls' dreams!!!

Gru hits the phone with his spatula and hangs up.    Turns and
sees Agnes standing there.

                     AGNES
          Ooh ooh!   When's the Fairy Princess
          coming?

Gru stares down at Agnes' big excited eyes. He opens his
mouth to tell her the truth, but can't do it.

                    GRU
          Any minute now!

Agnes squeals with excitement and runs off.

                     AGNES
          Yayyy!

Gru looks worried--what do I do now?    He signals two minions.

                    GRU
          Stall them.


EXT: BACKYARD - LATER

A hand-painted piece of cardboard reading "THE MAGIC SHOW" is
placed on an easel. Agnes and all of the little kids sit in
a semicircle on the grass. Two minions dressed as magicians
are doing a magic act with Edith as their assistant. One
minion blows up a balloon and puts it in Edith's mouth. Then
the other whips out a CHAINSAW and fires it up, heading
toward her.

Margo sees this and quickly intervenes.

                    MARGO
          Whoa! Whoa! Okay, okay, alright.
          That's enough of the magic show!

The minions don't hide their disappointment.

                     MINIONS
          Awwww.
          DESPICABLE ME 2            CINCO & KEN DRAFT   5.


Margo suddenly looks around as if she just heard something.

                    MARGO
          Wait, did you hear that? It
          sounded like the twinkling sounds
          of magical fairy dust.

                    AGNES
              (gasps)
          It's the fairy princess!   She's
          coming!

Margo gasps and points up to the sky.

                      MARGO
          Look!

Edith spits out her magic balloon in horror and we follow it
up to reveal--

Gru. Dressed in a PUFFY PINK DRESS, fairy wings, glittery
eyelashes and tiara and magical wand.

Up on top of Gru's house, the minions struggle to lower him
down on a rope. Edith's balloon floats by and distracts
them.

They let go of the rope and Gru swings wildly, smashing into
the wall of the house and crashing to the ground.

                      GRU
          Aaaaaahh!

He stands up and tries to cover.

Agnes SIGHS HAPPILY, in awe of the fairy princess.

                    GRU (CONT'D)
              (in falsetto)
          It is I, Gru...zinkerbell! The
          most magical fairy princess of all!
          And I am here to wish Princess
          Agnes a very happy birthday!

Gru sprinkles the girls with glitter and they continue to
stare, frozen. Then a LITTLE GIRL raises her hand and speaks
with a lisp.

                    LITTLE GIRL
          How come you're tho fat?

Gru grits his teeth, then forces a smile and speaks with a
high-pitched, dreamy voice.
          DESPICABLE ME 2            CINCO & KEN DRAFT    6.


                    GRU
          Because my house is made of candy
          and sometimes I eat instead of
          facing my problems.

The girl starts to ask another question.

                    LITTLE GIRL
          How come you have-

Gru cuts her off with a puff of fairy dust to the face.   She
COUGHS.

                     GRU
          Okay!   Time for cake!

As the kids run to the table, Agnes approaches Gru.

                    AGNES
          Thank you, Gru-zinkerbell. You're
          the best fairy princess ever!

Gru smiles.

                    GRU
              (in falsetto)
          You are welcome, little girl.

She runs off, but quickly returns.

                    AGNES
              (whispers in his ear)
          I know it's really you, Gru. I'm
          just pretending for the other kids.

She runs off again to join her friends. Gru watches her go.
Couldn't be happier. Then he is approached by JILLIAN, a
heavily-Botoxed mom.

                    JILLIAN
          Hey there, Gru, Mr. Life of the
          Party!

                    GRU
              (forcing a smile)
          Hello, Jillian.

                    JILLIAN
          Sooooo, I'm gonna go out on a limb
          here, but my friend Natalie is
          recently single, and...
           DESPICABLE ME 2             CINCO & KEN DRAFT   7.


In the background, a homely NATALIE leans against a buffet
table and seductively raises her eyebrows at Gru. The table
collapses to the ground beneath her.

                     GRU
               (realizes what's going on)
           No, no, no, get off of the limb
           right now. No limb.

                     JILLIAN
           Oh, come on...she's a riot. She
           sings karaoke, she has a lot of
           free time, looks aren't that
           important to her...

In the background, Natalie inadvertently walks in front of a
bottle pitch game, is struck by a ball, and falls to the
ground.

                     GRU
           No, Jill's, that is not happening.
           Seriously. I'm fine.

                     JILLIAN
               (calling after Gru)
           Okay, fine. Forget Natalie.        How
           about my cousin Linda?

Gru walks off, passing by Edith and Margo.

                        GRU
           No.

                     JILLIAN
           Oh, oh! I know someone whose
           husband just died!

SPLASH!   Suddenly Jillian is sprayed in the face with water.

Reveal Gru holding a HOSE with a SPRAY NOZZLE.

                        GRU
           I'm sorry.     I did not see you
           there.

SPLASH!   He sprays her again.    She falls down.

                        GRU (CONT'D)
           Or there.

He drops the hose and walks away, CHUCKLING softly.
             DESPICABLE ME 2             CINCO & KEN DRAFT         8.


EXT: GRU'S HOUSE - DUSK

Gru takes Kyle out to the front yard.

CAMERA POV

A camera with nightvision is watching them. The screen
analyzes Kyle and a readout comes out as "SPECIES: UNKNOWN."
Kyle sniffs Gru's flowers.

                       GRU
             Kyle... Kyle!

Then it analyzes Gru and the readout says "TARGET ACQUIRED."

                       GRU (CONT'D)
             Ky--Kyle!   No, do not do your
             business on the petunias!

Kyle lifts up his leg next to Gru's flowers.

He picks Kyle up and places him next to his neighbor's bush.

                       GRU (CONT'D)
             There you go. Those are Fred's.
             Go crazy.

Kyle does and the bush immediately withers and dies.         Gru
CHUCKLES.

                         GRU (CONT'D)
             Good boy.

                         VOICE (O.S.)
             Mr. Gru?

Gru turns and sees Lucy Wilde standing there.

                        GRU
             Wha?   I didn't... What... Yes?

                       LUCY
                 (holds up her badge)
             Hi! Agent Lucy Wilde of the AVL.
                 (realizes her badge is
                  upside down)
             Oh. Whoops.
                 (clears her throat, all
                  business)
             Sorry, you're gonna have to come
             with me.

                       GRU
             Oh, sorry, I--Freeze Ray!
          DESPICABLE ME 2                 CINCO & KEN DRAFT      9.


Gru whips out his FREEZE RAY and fires it.       A WALL OF ICE
heads for Lucy.

But before it gets to her, Lucy pulls out a retractable gun
from her purse, which acts as a FLAMETHROWER. Melting the
ice.

                    LUCY
          You know you really should announce
          your weapons after you fire them,
          Mr. Gru. For example--

She pulls out a LIPSTICK. Fires it at Gru. The tip flies
through the air and connects with his chest, latching on.
ZZZZZAPPP! It tases him, which sends his body flailing in
different funny poses before passing out.

                    LUCY (CONT'D)
          Lipstick Taser! Oh, it works so
          good.


EXT: STREET - LATER

Lucy tries to drag Gru to her car, but he's too heavy.

                         LUCY
          Man.    Ugh.     Large...person.

She gets an idea.

Lucy gets into her car. In the background, we see Gru begin
to come to, but he is struck by Lucy's car as she pulls back
and is knocked out again.

                    LUCY (CONT'D)
          Oh...sorry!

Closer now, Lucy gets out and stuffs his body into the trunk.

Just then Tom and Stuart come out of Gru's garage and see
their boss being loaded in. Lucy struggles to close the
trunk.

                    LUCY (CONT'D)
          Get...in...there...you...big...man!

SLAM! Lucy finally slams the trunk then quickly gets into
the vehicle.

Tom and Stuart exchange horrified looks.

                         TOM AND STUART
          Boss!
         DESPICABLE ME 2             CINCO & KEN DRAFT   10.


They take off running after the car as it pulls away, running
as fast as their tiny legs will carry them. They get right
behind it and Tom LEAPS up onto the trunk. He reaches his
hand out to Stuart, who is falling behind.

                    TOM
          Koom ey lah!

                    STUART
          Koom ey lah! Koom ey lah!

Stuart leaps for the bumper and Tom catches him by his
overall straps. Tom holds on tight as Stuart dangles from
the back of the car, his overall straps stretching way out.

                    STUART (CONT'D)
          Aaaaaaiiieeeaaaiiieeeaaaah!

As Lucy turns a corner, he slams into some garbage cans and
ends up skiing behind the car in a cardboard box.

Now in the box, Stuart continues to ride behind the car, and
even starts to get the hang of that, too. He waves at Tom,
and Tom waves back.

                    STUART (CONT'D)
          Woooo!

                    TOM
          Ooooh!

All is good until they go past a clothesline and a sheet gets
stuck on Stuart.

The sheet forms a parasail which lifts Stuart up into the
air. He strikes a Superman flying pose. Then a flock of
GEESE fly toward him and one actually slams into his face.

                    STUART
          Quack quack!

It SQUAWKS at him as it flies off.

Lucy spots the commotion in her side view mirror and slams on
the brakes. SCREECH! Both minions fly forward--


INT: LUCY'S CAR - SAME

Lucy sees this, drives forward, and opens the convertible
top, causing the Minions to land right in the passenger's
seat. They strike threatening karate poses.
          DESPICABLE ME 2                CINCO & KEN DRAFT   11.


                        TOM AND STUART
           Hi-YAH!!

Lucy tases them and they pass out.       She floors it.


EXT: STREET - SAME

Lucy's car continues driving until it reaches a crowded PIER.
And doesn't stop. It drives right off the end of the pier.
A confused fisherman leaps for his life.

                        CONFUSED FISHERMAN
           What the--     Oh!

SPLASH!


INT: OCEAN - SAME

Lucy's car now transforms into an UNDERWATER VEHICLE. As the
minions come to, one of them tries playing with the radio
until Lucy slaps his hand away. They speed through the sea
and an octopus slams into her windshield. She turns on the
wipers, which hits the octopus in the face until he's had
enough and swims off in a cloud of ink.

She HONKS her HORN as she passes through a school of fish.

                        MINIONS
           Whoa...

As the fish pass the Minions look ahead to see a shark
heading for them with his mouth open. They SCREAM. Lucy
quickly steers the car out of harm's way. They pass by
several more sharks until they arrive at a GIANT SUBMARINE
with the letters "AVL" on the side.

A HATCH opens and Lucy's car goes inside.       The hatch closes
behind her.


INT: AVL SUB - SAME

The water drains out from the holding dock. A buffer and
hair dryer come out to dry off the car. A squeegee wipes off
the windshield.

Then the platform the car is on lowers down.
         DESPICABLE ME 2             CINCO & KEN DRAFT   12.


INT: AVL ROOM - DAY

Lucy's car lowers into the center of the room as a large
circular table assembles around it, effectively locking them
in.

Lucy and the Minions get out of the car. She pushes a button
on her remote and Gru, with a starfish attached to his head,
is ejected from the trunk.

                     GRU
              (groggily)
          Ugh...ooh...what...where...ah...oh,
          foot's asleep...ah...pins and
          needles...

                    SILAS (O.S.)
          Good afternoon, Mr. Gru.

                      GRU
          Ehhh...

                    SILAS
          I apologize for our methods in
          getting you here.

                    LUCY
          I don't. I'd do it again in a
          heartbeat. I am not gonna lie--I
          enjoyed that. Every second of it.
          Gave me a bit of a buzz, actually.

                    SILAS
          That's enough, Agent Wilde.

                    LUCY
          Sorry, sir.

                    GRU
          Okay, this is bogus!

Gru peels the starfish off his head and drops it onto Tom's.
Stuart LAUGHS at him.

                    GRU (CONT'D)
          I don't know who you people think
          you are, but--

A WAITER comes over with tea for Silas.

                    SILAS
          We are the Anti-Villain League.

As Silas summons a map that shows all of the AVL offices
around the world, Lucy's car drops out of the way. Stuart is
trapped on the lowering platform and he scrambles to get back
onto stable ground. Silas continues.

                    SILAS (CONT'D)
          An ultra-secret organization
          dedicated to fighting crime on a
          global scale. Rob a bank? We're

          Fuji? Or even steal the moon?
          Then we notice.

                    GRU
          First of all, you've got no proof
          that I did that. Second, after I
          did do that, I put it back!

                     SILAS
          We're well aware of that, Mr. Gru.
          That's why we've brought you here.
              (beat)
          I am the League's director, Silas
          Ramsbottom.

Upon hearing the name, Tom and Stuart start giggling.

                       TOM
          Bottom.

                    TOM AND STUART
          Heeheheeeeheeehee.

Silas bristles at this, and glances over at Lucy.

                       SILAS
          Hilarious.     Agent Wilde...

                    LUCY
          Oh, me now...?

She continues the de-briefing, turning to the screens, which
show an image of the Magnet Ship stealing the lab.

                     LUCY (CONT'D)
          Um, recently an entire top secret
          lab disappeared from the Arctic
          Circle. Yeah, the entire lab.
          Just whoosh. Voom! Gone. Where
          did it go?
         DESPICABLE ME 2              CINCO & KEN DRAFT    14.


                    GRU
          I don't care.

The screen shows FOOTAGE of a TINY LITTLE BUNNY in a
scientific lab. Furry and adorable.

                    LUCY
          The lab was devoted to experiments
          involving PX-41, a transmutation
          serum. What is PX-41, you ask?
          Mmmm, it's pretty bad... Look.

A LABCOAT TECHNICIAN approaches the bunny with a SYRINGE
containing the purple liquid. Injects some in its butt.

                     TOM AND STUART
          Aaah!

Instantly the bunny transforms into a HIDEOUS PURPLE MONSTER
BUNNY. Gru and the Minions smile, impressed.

Then it goes crazy and attacks the scientist.    Gru covers his
eyes and the Minions pass out.

                     GRU
          Oh!

The bunny attacks the technician, then the camera...and the
film is over.

                    GRU (CONT'D)
          Hmm, you usually don't see that in
          bunnies.

                     SILAS
          As you can see, in the wrong hands,
          the PX-41 serum could be the most
          devastating weapon on earth.
              (struggles to get through
                the opening in the table)
          Fortunately it has a very distinct
          chemical footprint, and using the
          latest chemtracking technology, we
          found traces of it in the Paradise
          Mall.

On the screens we see images depicting a highly technical
diagram of the shopping mall.

                     GRU
          Ha!   A mall?
         DESPICABLE ME 2             CINCO & KEN DRAFT   15.


                    SILAS
          Precisely. And we believe that one
          of these shop owners is a master
          criminal.

Silas scrolls through pictures of the mall's shop owners.

                    SILAS (CONT'D)
          And that's where you come in. As
          an ex-villain, you know how a
          villain thinks, how a villain acts.

                    LUCY
          The plan is to set you up
          undercover at a shop in the mall,
          where hopefully you'll be able to--

                    GRU
          Okay, I see where this is going,
          with all the Mission Impossible
          stuff, but no. No! I am a father
          now. And a legitimate businessman.
          I am developing a line of delicious
          jams and jellies.

Silas shoots him a look.    He CHUCKLES.

                    SILAS
          Jams and...jellies?

                     GRU
          Oh, attitude! That's right! So
          thanks, but no thanks.
              (beat)
          And here's a tip--instead of tasing
          people and kidnapping them, maybe
          you should just give them a call!
          Good day, Mr. Sheepsbutt!

                    SILAS
          Ramsbottom.

                    GRU
              (chuckles)
          Oh, yeah, like that's any better!

Gru turns and heads for the door, followed by Tom and Stuart,
who continue to GIGGLE about Ramsbottom's name.

Gru exits the AVL headquarters, which he now sees is on a
SUBMARINE.

Lucy leans out the door and taps him on the shoulder.

                    LUCY
          Look, I probably shouldn't be
          saying this, but your work as a
          villain was kind of amazing, so if
          you ever want to get back to doing
          something awesome--give us a call.

She hands Gru her BUSINESS CARD.   Gru takes it and stares at
it.


EXT: OCEAN - LATER

Gru rows back to shore as Tom yells to him like a coxswain.
Gru GRUNTS with each stroke.

                    TOM

Gru carries a sleeping Agnes upstairs.

Gru enters to find Margo and Edith not in bed.   Margo is
texting someone.

                      EDITH
          Why not?    Are you scared?

Gru stares back at Edith.     Gets a far-away look in his eyes.


EXT: PLAYGROUND - FLASHBACK - DAY

We flash back to LITTLE GRU on the school playground. He
stares, lovesick, at a CUTE LITTLE BLONDE GIRL, named LISA.

                    LISA
              (to her friends)
          Hey, did you guys see the moon
          landing on TV?

                    GIRLS
          Yeah, I can't believe it.     It's so
          cool...

                    LISA
          Yeah, and you know what--

Gru approaches her.

                    LITTLE GRU
          Excuse me, Lisa?

But she doesn't notice him.    He tries again.

                     LISA
               (to her friends)
          I was talking to Billy the other
          day.

          No way.

                    LISA
          He is so cute.

Gru clears his throat.

                    LISA (CONT'D)
          And I think he likes me.

                    GRU
          Hey Lisa, I was wondering if you--

Gru reaches out and taps her shoulder with his pointer
finger.

Then one of the other little girls points to Gru's finger on
Lisa's shoulder.

          Ewww! Gru touched Lisa!         Gru
          touched Lisa!

The other girls turn and squeal, horrified.

                      GIRLS
          Eeeeewww!

A little buck-toothed red-haired girl shouts out to the
entire playground.

                    RED HAIRED GIRL
          Lisa's got Grooties!

The playground erupts with SCREAMS and everyone turns and
runs away.

Little Gru is left alone.     Crushed.


INT: GIRLS' BEDROOM - NIGHT

Gru comes out of the flashback.

                    GRU
          Scared? Of what? Women?! No,
          that's bonkers! I just-- I have no
          interest in going on a date, that's
          all. Case closed. I'm not scared--
          of women... or dates... let's go to
          bed.

Gru gives each girl a goodnight kiss.

                    GRU (CONT'D)
          Goodnight, Edith.

Then he goes over to Margo, who's already in bed.

                    GRU (CONT'D)
          Goodnight, Margo.

She continues texting as he gives her a kiss.

          Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Well, hold
          the horses. Who are you texting?

          name or a boy's name?

                    MARGO
          Does it matter?

                    GRU
          No, no, it doesn't matter... Unless
          it's a boy!

                    AGNES
          I know what makes you a boy.

Gru turns to Agnes, concerned.

                    GRU
          Uh...oooh...you...do?

                    AGNES
          Your bald head.

Gru nods, relieved.

                       GRU
          Oh, yes...

                    AGNES
          It's really smooth. Sometimes I
          stare at it and imagine a little
          chick popping out. Peep peep peep.

Gru sighs and gives her a kiss.

                    GRU
          Goodnight, Agnes.   Never get older.

Gru turns out the light and leaves the room.


INT: LAB - DAY

Gru rides the elevator tube down to his lab, passing minions
in various stages of jelly making. A sign reading, JELLY
TESTING AREA" has been hastily pasted over a nuclear warning
sign.

A SUPERVISOR MINION checks his clipboard as the MINION next
to him steals a banana from his pocket. He turns, but the
Minion who stole the banana has hidden it in his mouth. We
see the ends of the banana pushing out his cheeks.

                      SUPERVISOR MINION
          Hey, oh!    Me banana!
         DESPICABLE ME 2             CINCO & KEN DRAFT   20.


The Minion with the banana in his mouth shrugs.

A single apple is passed down a line of Minions in the least
efficient way possible.

A few Minions mash fruits in large vats ala "I Love Lucy."

One wears a bunch of fruit on his head like Carmen Miranda
and sings the CHIQUITA BANANA song. His supervisor comes
over and tells him to get back to work.

The Minion tries to get out of the vat of fruit, but slips
and falls down into a large test-tube filled with mashed
fruit.

Then all of the mashed fruit is flushed down a large hole
where it is injected into jelly jars passing by on a conveyor
belt. The trapped Minion is injected into one of the jars.

Gru enters the lab and greets the minions.

                    GRU
          Hey, Tim, nice haircut!

He points at Tim.

                    GRU (CONT'D)
          Donnie, hang in there, baby!    It's
          almost Friday.

Gru high-fives Donnie as he approaches Dr. Nefario.

                    GRU (CONT'D)
          So, how's today's batch, Dr.
          Nefario?

                    DR.    NEFARIO
          I developed a    new formula which
          allowed me to    get every known kind
          of berry into    one flavor of jelly.

Gru sticks his finger in and tastes the purple goo in the
jar. Makes a disgusted face, then attempts a smile.

                     GRU
              (faking it)
          That tastes good...
              (gags)
          Love the flavor of that...

                    DR. NEFARIO
          It's horrible, isn't it?
         DESPICABLE ME 2           CINCO & KEN DRAFT    21.

          progress!
              (to the Minions)
          Here, try some of this.

He hands a jar to a minion, who tries it. He GAGS!   Another
minion tastes some and scrapes it off his tongue. They smash
the jar and all the minions run away, disgusted.

                    GRU (CONT'D)
          Whoa... okay, just because
          everybody hates it doesn't mean
          it's not good.

Dr. Nefario hangs his head.

                    DR. NEFARIO
          Listen, Gru. There's something
          I've been meaning to talk to you
          about for some time now.

                     GRU
          What?   What's wrong?

                    DR. NEFARIO
              (clears his throat)
          I miss being evil. Sinister plots,

          live for! I mean, don't you think

          It's a great opportunity for me,

Dr. Nefario presses a button and his stuff folds itself up

           The twenty-one fart gun salute!

FART!   FART!   FART!

Dr. Nefario COUGHS.     His eyes are watering (and not only from
the smell).

                     DR. NEFARIO
           Uh, I counted twenty-two.

Dave CHUCKLES, guilty.    Dr. Nefario fires up the scooter.

                     DR. NEFARIO (CONT'D)
           Farewell, my friends.

The minions CRY. Dr. Nefario pushes another button on the
scooter, transforming it into flying mode. He GUNS the
engine and it begins flying away. At the slowest pace
possible. Everyone just stands there awkwardly.

                     DR. NEFARIO (CONT'D)
           This may take a while. Go about

Everyone walks off.

Gru examines Lucy's business card.     Makes a decision.

A Minion wears a French Maid's outfit and SINGS as he vacuums
the floor. The doorbell rings.

The Minion opens the door to see who it is.

          Hello?

A shadow falls across the terrified minion as something

The vacuum moves back and forth across the floor by itself.
Another Minion walks by wearing a different Maid outfit. He
doesn't see the other Minion and closes the door.

Then he opens it again, cleans the doorknob, and closes it.

                    MARGO
          Hey, what celebrity do you look
          like?

                    GRU
          Ummm...Bruce Willis.

The girls stare at him blankly.

                       MARGO
          Mmmm...no.

                    AGNES
          Humpty Dumpty!

                    EDITH
          Ooh, Gollum!

The girls LAUGH.

                    GRU
          Okay, what are you doing?

                    AGNES
          We're signing you up for online
          dating!

                    GRU
          Oh, okay...WHAT?! No, no, no, no,
          no, no, no, no, no.

Gru grabs the laptop away from the girls.

                    EDITH
          Aw come on, it's fun.

                    MARGO
          And it's time for you to get out
          there.

                       GRU
          No! Stop!      No one is ever getting
          out there!     Ever!

Gru hands a Minion the laptop, accidentally hitting him in
the face.

                    GRU (CONT'D)
          Okay, now for the announcement:    I
          have accepted a new job.

                    MARGO
          Whoa--really?

                    GRU
          Yes, I have been recruited by a top
          secret agency to go undercover and
          save the world!

                    EDITH
          You're gonna be a spy?!

                    GRU
          That's right, baby! Gru's back in
          the game! With gadgets and weapons
          and cool cars...the whole deal.

                       EDITH
          Awesome!

Agnes looks up at him in awe.

                    AGNES
          Are you really gonna save the
          world?

Gru looks at Agnes.

                     GRU
          Yes.   Yes I am.

He coolly puts on a pair of sunglasses.

We pan to Dave mimicking Gru with a pair of sunglasses.

                       DAVE
          Mocha!

And then to Kevin dressed in an Amish beard and tie.

                       KEVIN
          Cacao!

And then Stuart dressed as a little girl with pigtails.

                       STUART
          Papadam?


EXT: MALL - DAY

Establishing.


INT: MALL - SAME

Gru comes down the escalator wearing the sunglasses, with the
three disguised Minions behind him. Stuart gets his dress
caught in the escalator. It comes off and he hides in a
nearby potted plant.

Gru glances at a store called the "EAGLE HAIR CLUB." He then
arrives at a charming, pink CUPCAKE STORE. The sign reads,
"BAKE MY DAY" Gru frowns and takes off his sunglasses.

                       GRU
          Hm.     "Bake My Day."   Blech.


INT: BAKE MY DAY - CONTINUOUS

Gru unlocks the door and enters. JINGLE! BELLS on the door
ring. The inside is sugary and clean and quaint. Gru takes
it all in. Then turns to the minions.

                    GRU
          Alright, here is the cupcake recipe
          I got off the internet.

The minions excitedly grab the recipe and head for the
kitchen. Gru kicks Stuart, who is still staggering around in
the potted plant.

                     GRU (CONT'D)
          And don't go nuts with the
          sprinkles!

Gru is left alone. He looks around. Sees a BUNNY CUPCAKE in
a glass cake dish. Then a SHARK CUPCAKE in the next cake
dish. And in the next dish he sees Lucy's head. She makes a
funny face.
         DESPICABLE ME 2             CINCO & KEN DRAFT     27.


Gru SCREAMS, which causes Lucy to SCREAM and jump up, hitting
her head on one of the shelves, sending all of the CUPCAKES
flying.

Lucy immediately goes into action, using incredible and
frankly weird-looking MARTIAL ARTS MOVES to dispatch the
cupcakes as they fly toward her.

                       LUCY
          Ha! Yaa!      Ho! Ooof!   Zaaa!   Ay-ay-
          ay-ay-ay!

She successfully eliminates all of the cupcakes, then turns
to Gru, out of breath.

                     LUCY (CONT'D)
          Whoo. Wasn't expecting that.
              (strikes a martial arts
               pose)
          Or was I?

Gru has a cupcake stuck to the top of his head, frosting side
down. Lucy gestures as if he's got a little food on his
face.

                    LUCY (CONT'D)
          Ooh... you got... You got... a
          little...

The cupcake slowly slides down, then falls to the floor.    It
leaves a long smear on Gru's face.

                    LUCY (CONT'D)
          Here, I'll-- I'll get it.

Gru stands frozen as she tries to clean him up.

                    LUCY (CONT'D)
          Oh, that's just spreading...um...

                    GRU
          Alright, alright.    I got it.    I got
          it!... Stop it!

Lucy backs off.

                       LUCY
          Oh!     I'll let you get it.

Gru SIGHS and wipes the frosting off his face.

                    LUCY (CONT'D)
          Yeah, what you just saw there was a
          little something new I've been
          working on. It's a combination of
          Jujitsu, Krav Maga, Aztec warfare,
          and krumping.

                    GRU
          Okay, that's weird--why are you
          here?

                    LUCY
          On assignment from Silas.   I'm your
          new partner. Yay!

                    GRU
          What?! No, no "yay." Ramsbottom
          didn't say anything about a
          partner.

                     LUCY
          Well, seems that because of your
          checkered past, everyone else
          refused to work with you. But not
          me. I stepped up. And I'm new, so
          I kind of have to do what they tell
          me anyway.

Gru is about to respond when Dave the minion comes out the
kitchen door. He carries a cupcake in the shape of a Minion.

                    DAVE
          Walla!

Immediately Lucy moves with lightning-quick reflexes. She
smashes his cupcake, flips him into the air, and pins him to
the counter. Dave SCREAMS.

                    LUCY
          You know this guy?

                    GRU
          Yes, he's one of my minions.

                    LUCY
          Oh, I'm sorry. I should have
          known.

She releases him.

                    LUCY (CONT'D)
          You're free to go.

Dave stares at Lucy. Immediately smitten. A magical glow
appears around her as romantic music plays. We go into
Dave's fantasy.


EXT: BEACH - DAY - FANTASY

Dave and Lucy run along a beach together hand in hand.


EXT: FIELD - DAY - FANTASY

Dave and Lucy have a romantic picnic together. They toast
each other with champagne. Dave drinks from the bottle.


EXT: BRIDGE - NIGHT - FANTASY

Lucy and Dave sit on the railing of a moonlit footbridge.
Both fire ROCKETS into the air to create fireworks and are
about to kiss when--

                    GRU (V.O.)
          Dave...


INT: BAKE MY DAY - DAY

Back to reality, where Dave is staring up at Lucy,
lovestruck.

                    GRU
          Earth to Dave!     You can leave now.

Dave goes back into the kitchen, never taking his eyes off of
Lucy.


INT: MALL - DAY

CLOSE ON the Giant Cupcake on top of the cupcake shop. The
CHERRY on the Giant Cupcake rotates, revealing a CAMERA
hidden inside. VZZZZZT! The lens zooms.

                    GRU (O.S.)
          Now, what do we got? Who's on the
          list? Fire `em at me.



INT: BAKE MY DAY - SAME

Gru and Lucy stand next to each other under a domed lamp
lowered from the ceiling.
         DESPICABLE ME 2               CINCO & KEN DRAFT   30.


Inside the dome of the lamp, Gru and Lucy are uncomfortably
close together looking at a video screen.

                    LUCY
          First suspect...Hedda Blumentoft,
          proprietor of Mum's the Word Floral
          Shop.

The camera moves over to Mum's the Word Floral Shop and HEDDA
BLUMENTOFT.

                      GRU
          No.    Not her.

                    LUCY
          Okay, moving on...

The camera moves over to the "Stuff-A-Bear" store. CHUCK
KINNEY, a small perky man, holds up an empty teddy bear skin
for a little boy.

                    LUCY (CONT'D)
          Chuck Kinney, owner of "Stuff-A-
          Bear."

Kinney shoves the teddy bear's butt onto a sharp metal tube.
The bear inflates until it EXPLODES into a torrent of bear
skin and stuffing. The little boy CRIES.

                      LUCY (CONT'D)
          Ooh.

                    GRU
          I don't think so.

DING-A-LING-A-LING! The bell rings on the cupcake shop's
front door, signaling a customer.

                      EDUARDO (O.S.)
          Hello?

                      GRU
          Oh!

Gru and Lucy quickly hide their equipment, look up and see
EDUARDO PEREZ at the door. They try to act natural.

                    EDUARDO
          Buenos dias, my friends! I am
          Eduardo Perez, owner of Salsa &
          Salsa Restaurant, across the mall.
          Now open for breakfast. And you
          are?

                      GRU
             Gru. And this is Lucy.    And we are
             closed.

                       EDUARDO
             This is just gonna take un momento.
             I am throwing a big Cinco de Mayo
             party, and I am going to need two
             hundred of your best cupcakes
             decorated with the Mexican flag.
             It looks something like this.

He rips open his shirt, revealing a TATTOO of the Mexican
flag on his chest.

                       EDUARDO (CONT'D)
             What do you think?

He flexes and makes it wave.     Gru hides his eyes.

                          GRU
             Look away!

Lucy stares at it.

                       LUCY
             You-- Whoa... Hooo...

                       EDUARDO
             Anyway, I have to go. It's all
             settled! I pick `em up next week!
             Have a good day. Come by if you
             get a chance, okay?

He exits.    Gru GROANS, relieved.    Finally!

Then Eduardo pops back in.

                       EDUARDO (CONT'D)
             And welcome to the mall family!

Gru studies Eduardo's face and GASPS. He pictures Eduardo in
a red luchador mask surrounded by flames. Eduardo turns and
leaves. As soon as the door closes--

                       GRU
                 (whispers)
             El Macho.

                          LUCY
             What?

                       GRU
             But it couldn't be...

                    LUCY
          Wha-- What? What couldn't be??

                    GRU
          That guy looks exactly like a
          villain named El Macho. From about
          twenty years ago.


EXT: DESERT - DAY - FLASHBACK

Classic Spaghetti western sepia-toned shot of El Macho
looking menacing. He looks like the large Hispanic man from
the mall, only younger and wearing a Lucha Libre outfit and
mask (a mask which looks similar to the one Gru imagined).

El Macho pushes the BARKEEP out of the way and grabs a large
bottle from behind the bar.

                    GRU (V.O.)
          He was ruthless. He was dangerous.
          And as the name implies, very
          macho.

El Macho pours himself a shot and then smashes the bottle
over his own head.

He reaches down and pulls up a rattlesnake from below the
bar. He squeezes its head, squirting venom into the shot
glass. He drinks it down and then eats the glass.

He sticks the snake's fangs into a few dollars that he leaves
on the bar, before breaking through the wall behind him,
leaving an EL Macho-shaped hole.


EXT: STREET - DAY - FLASHBACK

El Macho head butts an armored truck and approaches the
passenger side window.

                    GRU (V.O.)
          He had a reputation for pulling off
          heists using only his bare hands.

When the ARMED GUARDS look over he punches through the bullet-
proof glass, knocking them both out of the truck. Then he
lifts the truck onto his back and runs down the street with
it.

                    GRU (V.O.)
          Ah, but sadly, like all the greats,
          El Macho was gone too soon.

EXT: SKY - DAY - PAST

A bird, flying in the air, is suddenly struck by an airplane.

                    GRU (V.O.)
          He died in the most macho way
          possible.

El Macho leaps out of the plane riding a SHARK, a ton of
DYNAMITE strapped to him. He plummets toward the mouth of an
ACTIVE VOLCANO.

                    GRU (V.O.)
          Riding a shark with 250 pounds of
          dynamite strapped to his chest into
          the mouth of an active volcano.

He pulls two grenades from behind his back, yanks the pins,
and holds onto them as he plunges into the volcano.

There is a MASSIVE EXPLOSION.

                    GRU (V.O.)
          It was glorious.


INT: BAKE MY DAY - DAY

Lucy stares at Gru, confused.

                    LUCY
          Yeah, sounds like El Macho's pretty
          dead...

                     GRU
          They never found the body. Oh no.
          All that was ever retrieved was a
          pile of singed chest hair.
              (beat)
          But... that face. It has got to be
          El Macho.

Lucy gets an excited look on her face.

                    LUCY
          Then what do you say you and I
          break into his restaurant?
          Tonight.

Gru nods at Lucy's invitation.

                    GRU
          Yes, that's good, because I'm
          telling you--if anybody in this
          place has the PX-41 serum...

Gru looks out the window and points at Eduardo riding up on
the escalator, scratching his butt.

                    GRU (CONT'D)
          ...it's him.


INT: GIRLS' BEDROOM - NIGHT

Gru enters and pushes the girls into their beds like a tour
guide anxious to finish a tour.

                    GRU
          Alright, alright, homework done,
          pajamas on, teeth brushed, time for

          What's the big hurry?

                    GRU
          I just... I have a lot of work to

          Work, what kind of work?

          ...good night, sleep tight, don't

Gru turns to leave, but Agnes is standing at the doorway.

          But you said you'd help me
          practice my part for the Mother's

                 (robotically)
             She kisses my boo-boos
             She braids my hair
             My mother is beyond compare
             We love you, mothers, everywhere!

Gru frowns.

                       GRU
             Wow! That was...something else. I
             really liked the way you smiled at
             the end. Let's try this one more
             time, but a teensy bit less like a
             zombie, okay?

                       AGNES
             Okay.
                 (still monotone)
             She kisses my boo-boos
             She braids my hair--

                        GRU
             Perfect!   Time to go!

As he heads for the door--

                       AGNES
             I don't think I should do this.

This stops Gru.

                       GRU
             Well, what do you mean?    Why not?

                       AGNES
             I don't even have a mom.

Ouch.   But Gru tries not to let this affect him.

                       GRU
             Well, you don't need one to do the
             show. I mean, you did the Veterans
             Day Pageant and you haven't been in
             combat.

Agnes looks up at Gru.

                    GRU
          Okay, well, then...maybe you can
          just use your imagination.

                    AGNES
          You mean I pretend I have a mom?

                    GRU
          Yes, right. You can do that, can't
          you?

Agnes smiles.

                    AGNES
          Yeah! I do that all the time!
          Thanks, Gru!

She gives him a kiss and runs off.   Gru watches her go, deep
in thought.


INT: REC ROOM - NIGHT

TWO MINIONS raise their ice cream sundaes and clink them
together!

                    MINIONS
          Hey!

Pull back to reveal many minions singing and dancing.

We move through the crowd, passing by the mace-wielding
minion with his helmet still backwards and a smaller server
minion with a tray of ice cream sundaes in mugs.

We cut up to the rafters, where more minions are dancing and
singing in formation, jumping and hopping all over the place
in elaborate dance routines.

Back on the floor, three arm-in-arm minions take the chorus.
One of them clearly having had one too many sundaes is being
held up by the other two.

Another minion tries to carry empty mugs down a spiral
staircase, but he's knocked off by a bunch of minions running
up the other way.

Several minions sit around a communal bowl of ice cream,
lazily sipping at it through long straws.

Gru enters and takes it all in.

Other minions raid an ice cream cart, hanging from the
canopy, drinking directly from the spouts.

                    GRU
          Alright, hey, hey--   No, no, no,
          no! Hey, please!

The Minions stop singing.

                    GRU (CONT'D)
          Kevin, Jerry, watch the girls for
          me, okay?
              (points)
          Dave, Stuart--come this way. With
          me! Come on!

Dave downs a jar of maraschino cherries and sprays whip cream
into his mouth before running after them, with a toothpick
umbrella in his mouth for good measure.

                      GRU (O.S.) (CONT'D)
          Come on!

Once they are gone, the Minions go back to singing and
laughing.


INT: GIRLS' BEDROOM - NIGHT

Margo, Edith and Agnes are fast asleep in their beds. Kevin
and Jerry sing them a lullaby. Then smile and quietly close
the door.


INT: HALLWAY - SAME

Kevin holds up a golf ball.   Jerry happily jumps up and down.

                    KEVIN
          Hey, putt-putt?

                      JERRY
          Oh!


INT: LIVING ROOM - LATER

Jerry puts the tee and ball in his mouth as Kevin stands on a
dresser, preparing to take a swing. He asks Jerry if he's
ready and Jerry gives a thumbs up.

                     KEVIN
          Una, doo--
              (laughs as he lowers the
               golf club to Jerry's

         DESPICABLE ME 2             CINCO & KEN DRAFT     38.


CRASH! CLANG! A noise comes from the backyard.      The minions
exchange looks. What was that?


EXT: BACKYARD - NIGHT

Kevin and Jerry step out into the yard and look around
nervously, armed only with the golf club and tee.

                       KEVIN
          Boca!

                    JERRY
              (scared)
          Boca!

They walk over to the garbage cans. The cans begins to
rattle. Kevin and Jerry SCREAM as a CAT pops up from one of
the cans. The cat MEOWS.

Kevin LAUGHS at him and imitates Jerry's scared face.

                       KEVIN
          Looka too!

Jerry slaps him.    Kevin slaps him back.   They start to slap
fight until--

A SPOTLIGHT comes down from above, lighting up the terrified
minions. Before they can scream...

WOOSH! Jerry is sucked up into the air as if being abducted
by aliens. Kevin grabs onto a flower, and then the cat to
try and anchor himself down, but they both fly up into the
air.

The light goes out. A few seconds later the light comes back
on and drops the cat back down. It turns off again and the
Minions are gone.


EXT: MALL - NIGHT

The mall is dark and the parking lot is empty, except for two
minions and Lucy's car.


INT: MALL - SAME

A lone SECURITY GUARD walks through the dark mall, listening
to music on his headphones. He passes by Eduardo's Salsa &
Salsa. Shines his light inside. All clear. He moves on.

Once the guard is gone, a floor tile is moved aside and Gru
peeks out. After making sure the coast is clear, Gru calls
down.

                    GRU
              (whispers)
          We're stealth ninjas.    We make no
          sound.

                     LUCY
          Right.   Gotcha.


INT: EDUARDO'S SALSA & SALSA - LATER

Lucy kicks the door open.

She enters.   Gru reacts.

                    GRU
          Alright, El Macho, you're going
          down.

But before Gru takes a step, Lucy stops him.

                      LUCY
          Wait!    Wait!

                      GRU
          What?

She produces a SPRAY CAN and sprays the air in front of her.
Gru frowns.

                    GRU (CONT'D)
          What are you doing?

                    LUCY
          I'm checking for laser beam alarm
          triggers.

                    GRU
          It's a restaurant!

                    LUCY
          You never know what kind of booby
          traps this guy could have set.
          Huh? C'mon!

                    GRU
          There are no booby traps!

Gru takes a step and kicks a TRIPWIRE attached to a tiny
bell. TING-A-LING! Lucy points to the bell.

                     LUCY
          Ha!   Booby!

Lucy GASPS as a door begins to creak open.      She hides behind
Gru.

A tiny CHICKEN hops out.      It CLUCKS.   Lucy is confused.

                    LUCY (CONT'D)
          Oh. There's a chicken. Are you
          lost little guy? You must be lost!

                     GRU
          Ha!   Some guard dog.

Suddenly, the chicken leaps into the air and lands on Gru,
pecking his bald head.

                    GRU (CONT'D)
          Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaiiiigh!

Gru runs in circles, trying to get the chicken off.

                    GRU (CONT'D)
          Get it off of me! Get it off of
          me! Get it off of me!

Gru SCREAMS as the chicken goes up his shirt and bursts out
of his sweater through the chest, "Alien"-style. He grabs
it.

                       GRU (CONT'D)
          I got you!

It pecks him on the head, escapes, and continues to attack
him.

Lucy thinks fast and grabs a tablecloth from a table.      She
lunges and covers the chicken with the table cloth.

                       LUCY
          I got it!     Ha!

She tightens the tablecloth around Gru's neck, trapping the
chicken and Gru's head inside. A muffled scream comes from
under the table cloth and Lucy realizes what she's done. Gru
runs around trying to get the tablecloth off his head.

Lucy does a karate flip/body slam on Gru and the chicken.
She removes the table cloth. Gru's head has been replaced by
the chicken!

                       LUCY (CONT'D)
          Ha!
         DESPICABLE ME 2              CINCO & KEN DRAFT   41.


She goes to karate chop the chicken, but it flies off and she
hits Gru in the face instead.

                      LUCY (CONT'D)
          Oh!

The chicken regroups, CLUCKS, and attacks.

Lucy acts fast and presses a button on her watch, squirting
FOAM onto the chicken.

FSSSSSSHT!   The foam instantly hardens into a glass ball
around the chicken. Only its head sticks out. It wobbles
back and forth like a Weeble. Lucy turns to Gru.

                    GRU
              (dazed)
          Ugh...

                     LUCY
          What is wrong with that chicken?
              (beat)
          Hey, that pollo? Es loco.

Gru is unimpressed.

                    LUCY (CONT'D)
              (noticing Gru's wounds)
          No? Okay, let's go.


INT: KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

Gru and Lucy step into the kitchen. Lucy pulls out a HIGH-
TECH SCANNING DEVICE and aims it around the kitchen.

                    GRU
          You getting anything?

                    LUCY
          No. Not yet. But hey, maybe you
          can find something with these x-ray
          goggles.

Lucy produces a pair of HIGH TECH goggles.    Gru shakes his
head.

                    GRU
              (skeptically)
          Bah...

Gru puts them on and looks around the kitchen.    We now see

          How're they working? Tell me, tell
          me!

Gru turns to Lucy and sees her as a SKELETON.

                     GRU
          Ahh!   Ooof!

                    LUCY
          What's wrong? Something wrong?

                    GRU
          Oh, that's an image I'll never get
          out of my brain. Blagh!

Gru makes a face, disturbed. Then quickly turns away and
spots something behind a painting on the wall...a safe. Sees
something inside it--a METAL CANISTER. Smiles.

                       GRU (CONT'D)
          I knew it!

He goes to the wall and removes the painting, revealing the
SAFE.

                    GRU (CONT'D)
          The serum is in here!

                    LUCY
          Ooh, then let's get it!

He produces a SAFE-CRACKING DEVICE and places it over the
combination wheel. Lights blink and it goes to work.

                    GRU
              (gleefully giggling)
          Oh, this is going to be good!

Eduardo enters the restaurant.   Senses something isn't right.
Frowns angrily.

                     EDUARDO
           Oh... somebody's going to die
           tonight.

He cautiously walks through the restaurant. Sees the chicken
in the ball of cement. Gasps.

                      EDUARDO (CONT'D)

Eduardo runs over to Pollito and picks him up.

          Hm.   Subtle.

They both run over to meet the car at the escalators.

The car heads for the escalators. As they reach the bottom,

one!

                    GRU
          Over here, over here!    Over...

Too late. The minions shake as they go up the bumpy stairs.
Once they reach the top they take a left and start driving in

in exasperation.

Just then, Eduardo emerges from the restaurant with fire in
his eyes and a knife in his hand. Eduardo produces many more
KNIVES and heads straight for them.

seductively.

It's a beautiful morning. An ICE CREAM TRUCK makes its way
down the street (playing the song the minions were singing
earlier). It stops and a couple of CHILDREN run to meet it.

Stuart opens Gru's front door, having heard the commotion.
Two other minions approach as well. Stuart spots the ice
cream truck and points to it, excited.

          Oh!   Oh!   Gelato!

And then suddenly a MOB OF MINIONS appears running for the

out their money.

A hush comes over the minions.

          Hey-ho! Gelato!

Suddenly the ice cream cone on top of the truck transforms
into a LARGE TUBE and extends itself above the minions.
Stuart offers the tube a wad of cash and attempts to order
gelato, but the it begins SUCKING the minions into it. ZUP!
ZUP! ZUP!

One by one the minions (dozens of them, including the minion
with his head still trapped in the jelly jar) are sucked into
the truck until there is only one left. He tries to make a
break for it, but the truck lowers a popsicle in front of
him.

Gru quickly stands up, revealing his legs, and takes several
steps toward Eagle Hair Club. Floyd looks over his shoulder,

closer.

The man looks confused and tries again.     Gru dodges and takes
off running. The man chases after him.

Gru accidentally knocks into a bent-over woman's rear end.
Insulted, she turns around, sees the man with the coffee, and
slaps him across the face. Unfortunately, Gru doesn't see
the escalator ahead and goes tumbling down the moving stairs.

and lands at the bottom of the escalator with a THUD! Flat
on his face, he hears a familiar voice call out.

          Hello.

                     EDITH
          Hi.

Agnes gazes lovingly at Lucy.   A magical glow appears around
Lucy, who smiles back.

                       AGNES
             Are you single?

                        LUCY
             Oh!   Goodness...

Gru, immediately uncomfortable, claps his hands together.

                       GRU
             Oh! Hey! I have an idea! Since
             Lucy and I have lots of work to do,
             why don't you girls go and explore
             the mall!

Gru quickly shuffles the girls away from Lucy, trying to get
out of the uncomfortable situation. Gru pulls out his
wallet.

                       GRU (CONT'D)
             Here is some money. Go buy some
             useless mall junk! Some headbands,
             and--

                       AGNES
             Are you gonna marry Lucy?

                       GRU
             Are you out of your gourd?    No!
             She just works with me.

                       AGNES
             Plus you love her.
                 (sings)
             You love her, you love her, you
             really really love her, and you're
             gonna get married, and I will be
             the flower girl, and--

                       GRU
             Okay, stop! That is a song of
             lies. I don't even like her!
                 (points to mall)
             Now go have fun!

Gru SIGHS.    The girls run off, but quickly return to hug Gru.

                       AGNES
             Almost forgot! Hugs!

                       MARGO
             Good luck saving the world.   Bye!

Lucy watches the group hug.      Smiles.   Gru heads back over to
Lucy, embarrassed by Agnes.

                    GRU
          Ha, ha, ha! Kids...right?
          They're...funny.

                    LUCY
          Those girls totally adore you.       I
          bet you're a fun dad.

                       GRU
          Huh.
              (beat)
          I am pretty fun.


INT: SHOPPING MALL - DAY

The girls are at the MALL FOUNTAIN. Agnes has her eyes
closed and a very intense look on her face, as if she's
really concentrating on something. There is something in her
tightly clenched fist. She tosses a PENNY. Then opens her
eyes, waiting for her wish to come true.

Then Edith emerges from the water wearing a DIVING MASK AND
SNORKEL, hands full of COINS.

                    AGNES
          Is that stealing?

                    EDITH
          Not if my wish was that I would get
          a lot of free coins.

Margo is busy texting.       Then something offscreen catches her
eye.

It's a boy. This is ANTONIO. Suave, cool, and a bit
dangerous. We watch in SLOW MOTION as he strolls behind the
fountain, and then disappears in its spraying water.

Margo looks for Antonio.       Backs into the fountain and nearly
falls into it.

                       MARGO
          Whoa!

Antonio catches her.

                    ANTONIO
          Cool glasses.

Margo CHUCKLES nervously.      He helps her back up.

                    ANTONIO (CONT'D)
          I'm Antonio.

                    MARGO
          I'm...Margo.

                    ANTONIO
          I was just going to get a cookie.
          Care to join me?

                      MARGO
          Uh, sure.    I'm...Margo.

They begin walking away together, then Margo is reminded of
her sisters when Edith loudly clears her throat.

                    MARGO (CONT'D)
          Um...I'll catch up with you guys
          later. Bye!

She turns and runs after Antonio.

                    EDITH
          Can I be the first to say...Ewwww!

Agnes grabs Edith and shakes her.

                    AGNES
          We gotta go tell Gru!


EXT: EAGLE HAIR CLUB - DAY

Gru approaches Eagle Hair Club.

                    GRU
          All right, I'm going in.

          Okay! I get it!     I get it!


INT: EAGLE HAIR CLUB - SAME

Gru fumbles with the automatic door, then enters Eagle Hair
Club.

                    FLOYD (O.S.)
              (chuckles)
          Welcome to Eagle Hair Club.

At the reception desk, a large chair shaped like an eagle
spins around. Sitting in the chair is Floyd, looking
sinister and petting a FURRY OBJECT that looks like a cat.

                    FLOYD (CONT'D)
          It's about time you showed up...Mr.
          Gru.

His pet BALD EAGLE perched next to him SQUAWKS.

                    GRU
          You...know my name?

                    FLOYD
              (chuckles)
          When someone moves into the mall
          who is follically challenged, I
          make it my business to know all
          about them. You are bald. And
          that is bad.

He strokes the furry object. Kisses it.    Then places it on a
MANNEQUIN HEAD. It's a TOUPEE.

                    FLOYD (CONT'D)
          There you go, my sweet.

Gru listens in on the headphones.

He steps over to a wall on which hangs a PAINTING of Floyd
flying with eagles.

                    GRU
          Wow, this looks interesting.     What
          is it?

Gru thrusts his hips at the painting.    Floyd watches him,
suspicious.

                    FLOYD
          I take it you're an art lover?

                      LUCY (IN HEADPHONES)
          No serum.

                    GRU
          Yeah, not so much.

He walks over to a podium with a TROPHY.     He thrusts his hips
at that, too.

                    GRU (CONT'D)
          Oh, how about this impressive
          trinket?

                    FLOYD
          I'd hardly call it a trinket, Mr.
          Gru.

                    LUCY

                    GRU
          Yeah, I don't care.

Floyd GRUMBLES in frustration.

Gru moves to a shelf filled with WIG SAMPLES.     He straddles
it.

                     LUCY

          Ah!    And what do we have here?

Floyd grabs a sample.

                    FLOYD
          These are my trial wigs.
              (holds out wig to Gru)
          You should take one.

Gru sticks his head into the shelf to investigate.

                    GRU
          No thanks. So what's on the other
          side of the wall?

                    FLOYD
          Here you are! Look at me!     Focus!

                       LUCY
                 (in headphones)
          Gru?

                    FLOYD
          I promise that this wig will
          transform you from ugly to
          irresistible.

Gru stares at the wig.    Clearly getting caught up in what
Floyd's saying.

Gru is about to respond when suddenly Edith and Agnes burst
in, out of breath.

                    AGNES
          MARGO HAS A BOYFRIEND!

                    EDITH

Gru stares at them.

                    GRU

Floyd shrugs.

INT: EDUARDO'S SALSA & SALSA - DAY

Gru enters to see Margo and Antonio sitting together in the
back of the restaurant together. Margo laughs at something
Antonio said.

                    MARGO
          Oh, you're so funny...

                      EDITH

These words hit Gru like a smack in the face.

          Oh, no, no, no! Do not say that
          they are...no no no, no!

He storms in.    Edith and Agnes follow.

          ...and my dream is to one day play
          video games for a living.

                      MARGO
          Wow.    You're so complicated.

Gru storms over to Margo.     Attempts a smile.

                      GRU
          Margo.    What is going on here?

                    MARGO

          Let's go.

SALSA MUSIC begins to play and a curtain opens across the
room. WOOSH! Someone leaps out, spinning like a tornado,
then lands in the middle of the restaurant with a flourish.
It's Eduardo.

                      MARGO
          Whoa!

Everyone in the restaurant cheers.    Gru frowns.   Not this
guy!

The music continues and Eduardo dances across the floor and
out into the mall where he grabs a passing SHOPPER and pulls
her into the restaurant.

The confused woman holds on for the ride    as Eduardo twirls
and dances her all around the floor. He     dips her and she
melts, as do all of the women watching.     Eduardo gazes into
the woman's eyes and produces a business    card.

                    EDUARDO
          Kids eat free on Tuesdays.

The woman grabs the business card from his hand with her
teeth.

Then Eduardo flings her across the floor and she twirls back
out into the mall where she knocks over her confused husband.
Then the song comes to an end and Eduardo strikes a final
pose.

Everyone in the studio cheers.

                     GIRLS
          Yeah!   Wahoo! Cool!   Awesome!

Everyone except Gru.   Eduardo walks over to him and gives him
a big warm hug.

                    EDUARDO
          So good to see you again, mi
          compadre!

Gru tries to get out of the hug as quickly as he can.

                    ANTONIO
          Oh, I see you have already met my
          father.

          Si! Look at this crazy small world
          we live in, eh? Come, sit, let me
          get you something.

Gru looks down and sees Eduardo's chicken glaring at him.    It
SQUAWKS. It's unsettling.

                    GRU
          Oh... look at you.

          Haha. He likes me!

Gru tries to pet the chicken but Pollito lunges at him.

          Oh, oh, I'm sorry, Pollito is
          usually very friendly.
              (cradling Pollito)
          He had a rough night.

The chicken stares relentlessly.   Gru CHUCKLES nervously.

                    GRU
          Well, we really should be going.
          Girls, come on.

Gru tries to gather the girls, but Eduardo stops him, pushing
Antonio and Margo closer together.

                    EDUARDO
          That is a pity. Young love is
          beautiful, no?

                    GRU
          No!
              (chuckling nervously)
          You know, they're not in love.
          They hardly know each other!

Eduardo suddenly lights up, having an idea.

                    EDUARDO
          You are right, Cabeza de Huevo!
          They must get to know each other
          better. Antonio, why don't you

          family to our Cinco de Mayo party?

          Si!

The girls are all thrilled at this, as is Antonio. As if on
cue, MUSIC begins playing and they all begin dancing
together.

Antonio takes Margo's hand and twirls her across the floor.
Gru stares at Antonio with a look that could kill. A waiter
comes by to give Gru a party drink, and he promptly crushes
the glass with his bare hands. His eye twitches.

             Koonga!

The Popsicle Minion, now nude, runs across the sand and jumps
into a clear, blue ocean. We pull back to reveal that
unbeknownst to any of the minions, this is all happening
inside a large terrarium, and they are being watched by a
mysterious figure in silhouette.


INT: FAMILY ROOM - DAY

Gru sits with his laptop. He's on the eVillain site. He
clicks through various images of El Macho. Edith chases
Kevin, who has the wig in his mouth. A minion sets a stack
of magazines on the coffee table.

Then "YOU ARE NO LONGER CONNECTED TO THE INTERNET" appears on
Gru's screen. He grimaces and calls out.

                       GRU
             Kevin, the wi-fi's out!     Kevin?

He looks to the minion at the coffee table.

                       GRU (CONT'D)
             Hey, Lance! Where the heck is
             Kevin?

The minion just shrugs and walks away.

                       GRU (CONT'D)
             Alright, we need to revisit the
             number of vacation days you guys
             get. I can't find anybody anymore!

DING-DONG!    Someone's at the door.      Gru turns to it.

                        JILLIAN (O.S.)
             Gru!   It's Jillian!

Gru pretends to shoot himself.

                       JILLIAN (O.S.) (CONT'D)
             I've got good news!

EXT: GRU'S HOUSE - SAME

Jillian and her artificially beautiful friend SHANNON stand
outside on Gru's porch. Shannon texts on her phone, looking
bored.

                    JILLIAN
          I have my friend Shannon here with
          me! I was thinking you two could
          get some grub, you know, tear it
          up! See what happens!


INT: GRU'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

                    JILLIAN (O.S.)
          Uhh, open up!

He sees Agnes walking by, singing softly and playing with her
unicorn. He whisper-shouts to her.

                    GRU
          Agnes! Agnes!     Tell Jillian I'm
          not here!

Agnes turns to the door.

                    AGNES
          Gru's not here!

                    JILLIAN
          Are you sure?

                     AGNES
          Yes!   He just told me!

Gru, panicking, shakes his head and wags his fingers.

                    AGNES (CONT'D)
          I mean no, he didn't just tell me!

                    JILLIAN
              (laughs)
          Agnes--where is Gru?

Gru makes the "zip your lips" gesture.

                    AGNES
          He's putting on lipstick!

Gru waves his arms.

                    AGNES (CONT'D)
          He's swatting at flies!
         DESPICABLE ME 2             CINCO & KEN DRAFT     62.


Gru waves his hand around his throat, making a "cut it off"
gesture.

                    AGNES (CONT'D)
          He's...chopping his head off!

Gru clenches his fists and grunts in frustration.

                    AGNES (CONT'D)
          He's...pooping?

Outside, Jillian and Shannon look confused.

                    JILLIAN (O.S.)
          I know you're in there, Gru!
          There's no way you're getting out
          of this!

Kyle enters the room, carrying the bag with the wig in his
mouth.


EXT: RESTAURANT - NIGHT

Establishing.


INT: RESTAURANT - SAME

Shannon sits at a table talking to Gru, who's offscreen.    A
waiter drops off a plate of spaghetti.

                    SHANNON
          I have to tell you, I was so
          nervous about tonight. I mean
          there's just so many phonies out
          there!

CUT TO Gru sitting across from her. Wearing a ridiculous WIG
from Floyd. And looking extremely uncomfortable.

                    GRU
          Yes, I hear you.
              (awkwardly laughs)

                    SHANNON
          Oh, so do you work out?

                    GRU
          Well...

                    SHANNON
          I mean, obviously, you don't, but
          would you consider it? Huh?

                    SHANNON (CONT'D)
          Physical fitness is very important
          to Shannon. As you can tell,
          right? Huh?

Shannon drops to the floor and starts doing push-ups.

                     GRU
          Ah.   I can tell.

                    SHANNON
              (mid-push-up)
          Solid.

She switches to one-armed push-ups.

                    GRU
          We are in a restaurant, you know.

Gru looks even more uncomfortable.

Just then Lucy (unseen by Gru) enters the restaurant.     She
approaches the HOSTESS.

                     LUCY
          Hi.   Takeout for Lucy?

                    HOSTESS
          Sure, just a sec.

The Hostess leaves. Lucy looks around and then spots Gru.
Sees him with the wig and Shannon who is now doing crunches
on the floor. Lucy narrows her eyes, then has an idea. She
presses a button on her watch, which transforms into a HIGH
TECH EAVESDROPPING DEVICE, and puts it in her ear. Now she's
able to hear Gru and Shannon talking. She watches them,
intrigued. Shannon has returned to her seat.

                    SHANNON
          Your accent is so exotic.

                   GRU
          Ah. Well, thank you very much.      I
          was--

                    SHANNON
          I know someone who can fix that for
          you. And you'll be talking normal
          in no time.

Gru is starting to sweat.

                   GRU
          Hahaha. Hoooo. Is it hot in here?
          Oof. How's the food?
         DESPICABLE ME 2             CINCO & KEN DRAFT     64.


He wipes his brow and accidentally shifts the wig on his
head. Shannon stares at Gru's hair.

                    SHANNON
          Wait a minute. Wait a minute.      Are
          you wearing a wig?

                    GRU
              (really sweating it)
          What? Ah!
              (readjusts the wig)
          I don't think so.

                       SHANNON
          I knew it.     You're a phony.   I hate
          phonies.

                    GRU
          Oh. What? No.      These locks are
          all mine...

                    SHANNON
          No they're not! You know what I'm
          gonna do? I'm gonna rip that thing
          off your head and show everyone
          what a bald-headed phony you are.

                    LUCY
          I don't think so, Miss Lady.

Lucy presses a button on her watch and a target sight pops
out.

Gru watches in horror as Shannon reaches across the table for
the wig.

Quickly Lucy presses another button on her watch which fires
a MINI-DART GUN at Shannon.

PLIP. The mini-dart goes into Shannon's butt, knocking her
out instantly. And saving Gru from certain humiliation. Gru
stares at the now sleeping Shannon, confused.

                    GRU
          Hello... Hello, are you...?

                       LUCY (O.S.)
          Hey, Gru.

Gru quickly removes the wig.

                    GRU
          Hello, Lucy, how you doin'...?

              (noticing Shannon)
          Wow, looks like your date's out for
          the count. It's like she's been
          shot with a mild moose
          tranquilizer.

Shannon MOANS like a MOOSE, then passes out again.

                    LUCY (CONT'D)
              (winks)
          Yeah, I'm winking `cuz that's what
          actually happened.

AN ITALIAN WAITER approaches.

                    ITALIAN WAITER
              (re: Shannon)
          `Scusi, whassa happenin' here?    She

                    LUCY
          Oh, she's just uh--

The waiter nods and leaves.

                    ITALIAN WAITER
              (laughs)
          Oh, oh, si, si...

Lucy turns to Gru.

                    LUCY
          Shall we take her home?


EXT: RESTAURANT - NIGHT

Gru and Lucy carry an unconscious Shannon out of the
restaurant. Her head gets stuck in the swinging doors on the
way out. They try to dislodge her and accidentally end up
throwing her headfirst into a lamp post. They pick her up
between them, Weekend at Bernie's-style. They wave to a
passing COP. The cop tips his hat.


EXT: SUBURBAN STREET - LATER

Gru and Lucy get in her car. But it's cramped with Shannon
in there too. She doesn't really fit.
         DESPICABLE ME 2            CINCO & KEN DRAFT     66.


EXT: SUBURBAN STREET - LATER

Lucy's car drives down the street. Gru and Lucy now have
plenty of room in the car. We boom up to see that Shannon
has been strapped to the roof like a deer.


EXT: SHANNON'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Gru and Lucy arrive at Shannon's house. Lucy comes to an
abrupt stop and Shannon flies off the roof and slams into the
car in front of them.


EXT: SHANNON'S HOUSE - LATER

Gru and Lucy sit on the front steps of Shannon's house.

                    LUCY
          Well, I think you did it. You just
          officially had the worst date ever.

                    GRU
          Huh, tell me about it.

                    LUCY
          Don't worry--it can only get better
          from here, right? But if it
          doesn't, you can always borrow my
          dart gun. I've had to use it on
          one or two dates myself.

                    GRU
          Yeah, you know, as far as dates go,
          I think I'm good with just the one.

Gru and Lucy exchange looks.   He CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY.   Time to
go.

                    LUCY
          Well, good night, partner.

She pats his shoulder and walks toward her car.   Gru gets up
to walk beside her.

                    LUCY (CONT'D)
          This was fun.

                     GRU
          Yes.   Surprisingly, it was.

They smile at each other, and she gives him a peck on the
cheek and walks away.

                    LUCY (CONT'D)
          See you tomorrow!

Gru smiles a big smile. Shannon slumps over on the porch
behind him. Could he be...falling in love?


INT: GRU'S BEDROOM - SAME

RIIIING! Gru's ALARM CLOCK goes off. He reaches out and
turns it off. Ready to greet the day.


INT: SHOWER - DAY

Gru happily washes in the shower, acting out a puppet show
with his rubber ducky.

          Quack!     Quack!    Quack!


INT: BATHROOM - DAY

Gru brushes his teeth with two toothbrushes. He jokingly
arranges them in his mouth like walrus tusks, then BARKS like
a seal.


INT: KITCHEN - DAY

HEART-SHAPED PANCAKES are served to the girls sitting at the
table. Edith makes a face at getting hers.

          So I take it the date went well?

                     GRU
          No!   It was horrible!

He laughs gleefully.    The girls exchange looks.    What?

Then he skips out of the room, dancing with a minion in the
kitchen. Agnes's face lights up. Yes!

EXT: STREET - DAY

Gru makes his way to work--on foot:

--he strolls down the sidewalk.

--he passes a MAILMAN and gives him a high five.

                       GRU
          High-five!

Then a POLICEMAN, with whom he exchanges mimed gunfire.

Then a NUN, with whom he bumps rumps.

                       GRU (CONT'D)
          Bump it.

Seeing something offscreen, Gru GASPS.

--he stops traffic so a happy family of DUCKS can cross the
street.

--he plays ultimate frisbee with a bunch of COLLEGE KIDS,
balancing the spinning disc on his pointy nose.

--he joins a group of OLD LADIES doing Tai Chi.

--he "air" drums with a couple of BUCKET DRUMMERS on the
curb.

--he picks a flower, then walks by a MAN and a WOMAN sitting
alone with their backs to each other at a cafe. He quickly
turns their chairs around so they find each other and hands
the man the flower for the woman. They smile and Gru goes
his merry way.


INT: SHOPPING MALL - DAY

Gru continues happily dancing through the mall on his way to
the cupcake shop. He shimmies with a FAT WOMAN on the
escalator, then GAPS and stops suddenly upon seeing Eagle
Hair Club closed. The MUSIC abruptly ends.

Gru sees Silas speaking with an AVL AGENT.    Gru approaches
him.

                    GRU
              (confused)

                    SILAS
          We got him.

                     GRU
          Got who?

                    SILAS
          Floyd Eaglesan! Our agents located
          a secret room in his shop last
          night, and uh, discovered this!

He snaps his fingers and an AVL agent hands him a METAL
CANISTER in a ziploc bag. Silas holds it up.

                    SILAS (CONT'D)
          It's empty, but we found traces of
          the PX-41 serum in it. He's our
          man. So somehow, in spite of your
          incompetence, we solved this one.

TWO AVL AGENTS carry Floyd away in handcuffs.

                    FLOYD
          I was framed! You won't get away
          with this! Get your mitts off of
          me! I am a legitimate businessman!

Gru turns back to Silas.    He is stunned by this.

                     GRU
          Ah.   Alright. So...what now?

                    SILAS
          Well, now you're free to go back to
          your "business." Mmmm. Jams and
          jellies. And it looks like Agent

              (remembering)
          Oh. Here. I wanted to give you

She holds out her lipstick taser.

                    GRU
          Your lipstick taser?

                    LUCY

Lucy ignores this and just waits, not wanting to leave.     She
and Gru stand there awkwardly.

                     GRU
          Well... it looks like they need
          you, so...

                    LUCY
          Yeah, I uh, I better go.    Bye, Gru.

And she leaves Gru.    He stands there.   Completely miserable.


EXT: STREET - DAY

Gru walks back home, completely depressed.

Walks past the college kids playing frisbee.      Catches the
frisbee and tosses it down the sewer.

Walks past the group of bucket drummers.    As he passes he
KICKS one of the buckets.

Walks past the old ladies doing Tai Chi. As they balance on
one leg he pushes them all and they all fall over.


EXT: GRU'S HOUSE - NIGHT

It's pouring rain.    Gru sits alone outside his house.
Miserable.

And then an UMBRELLA approaches him. It looks like it's
traveling on its own. But when it gets closer it lifts up,
revealing Agnes.

                    AGNES
          I brought you an umbrella.

Gru takes the umbrella and Agnes joins him.    They both huddle
under it.

                    GRU
          Yes, but...well, she's moving away.
              (sadly)
          I'm never going to see her again.

Agnes's face falls. All her hopes and dreams shattered.     But
she tries to encourage Gru.

                    AGNES
          Is there anything I can do to help?

                    GRU
          Oh, I don't--I don't think so,
          sweetheart.

                    AGNES
          Well, is there anything you could
          do?

Gru thinks.


INT: GRU'S OFFICE - DAY

Gru is on the PHONE.

                    GRU
          "Hello, Lucy. This is Gru. I know
          up to this point our relationship
          has been strictly professional, and
          you're leaving for Australia and
          all, but..."
              (struggles to get it out)
          Okay, here is the question. "Would
          you like to--to go out on a date?"

PULL BACK TO REVEAL Dave the minion standing across from Gru,
pretending to be on a cell phone on the other end of the
line. And wearing a RED-HAIRED WIG. He shrugs.

                       DAVE
          Eh, no.

                    GRU
          Okay, that's not helping.

He hangs up.

                       GRU (CONT'D)
          All right.     Here we go.   For real
          this time.

He stares at Lucy's card. Then turns to the phone. It's a
stand-off. He does stretches and calisthenics to psych
himself up. He SIGHS.

                    GRU (CONT'D)
          I can do this.

He stares down the phone again. It sits there, taunting him.
We cut back and forth between Gru and the phone, until
finally--

                      GRU (CONT'D)
          Agh!    I hate you!

He produces a FLAMETHROWER and burns up the phone.    Dave
dives out of the way.

                       GRU (CONT'D)
                 (satisfied)
          Ah.

RIIIIIING !!!    The FIRE ALARM goes off.

CHOP! Suddenly AXES chop through the wall. Several minions
in FIREMEN'S GEAR enter.  Another minion imitates a siren
through a bullhorn.

                      SIREN MINION
          Beedo!    Beedo! Beedo! Beedo!

One continues chopping everything in sight with his axe, then
chops his way right through the wall of the house and falls
outside. Another minion brings in a MASSIVE HOSE, turns it
on, and goes flying around the room as it whips around like a
snake. Dave tests out a fire extinguisher.

                      SIREN MINION (CONT'D)
          Beedo!    Beedo! Beedo! Beedo!

Gru takes away the bullhorn from the Siren minion.    But he
keeps on making the noise.

                      SIREN MINION (CONT'D)
          Beedo!    Beedo! Beedo!

Dave fires the extinguisher at the Siren minion. He makes
the noise again and Dave sprays him with the fire
extinguisher, sending him flying offscreen.

The minions enjoy another day at the beach. Kevin the Golf
minion drifts out in the water on an inner tube. He fixes
his coconut bra, then unpeels a banana and eats it.


INT: CONTROL ROOOM - SAME

A hand pulls a lever in a control room.

Suddenly a WHIRLPOOL appears in the water right next to him.
He gets sucked into it.

Kevin is pulled down to the bottom of the habitat and into a
TUBE.

Kevin pops out of the tube and lands in a waiting metallic
chair. His hat follows him down the tube and lands on his
head.

CLICK! A metal strap fastens around his waist.    He shrugs
and continues to eat the banana.

                     FRENCH MAID MINION (O.S.)
          Kevin?

Kevin looks over and sees the French Maid Minion strapped
into a chair nearby. He has a banana too.

                     KEVIN
          Tom?

They raise their bananas in the air.

                     KEVIN & FRENCH MAID MINION
          Bello!   Compai!

And then a GIANT DEVICE appears, looking like a huge, scary
HYPODERMIC NEEDLE filled with purple liquid. The needle
comes toward the French Maid Minion.

                    FRENCH MAID MINION
              (to the needle)
          Compai!

The needle is injected into him and administers the serum.

MORPHS into a PURPLE MINION.

          Blaaah!

Kevin points and LAUGHS at him. He doesn't see the needle
come down behind him. It injects him with the serum as well.

          Oh...


EXT: EDUARDO'S HOUSE - DAY

Gru's vehicle makes its way up the winding road to Eduardo's
house.


INT: GRU'S VEHICLE - SAME

Gru drives the vehicle, looking deeply depressed. The girls
sit in the back, dressed up for the Cinco de Mayo party.

                    MARGO, EDITH & AGNES
          Cinco de May-yay-yo! Cinco de May-
          yay-yo! Cinco de May-yay-yo!

Gru's expression doesn't change.   They pull up to the front
gate.


EXT: EDUARDO'S HOUSE GATE - SAME

Gru's vehicle pulls up in front of the open gate in front of
Eduardo's house. His car almost knocks a bunch of parked
cars off the cliff.

The grounds are set up for the most elaborate and fun Cinco
de Mayo party of all time. Sumptuous spreads of MEXICAN FOOD
everywhere. LANTERNS hanging from trees. PEOPLE having a
great time.

Gru and the girls enter the compound.

                     EDITH
          Whoa!   This place is awesome!

                    GRU
          Okay. Let's party. Ah? But first
          let's go over the rules. Because
          what is fun without the rules?

          Hai!

                       GRU
          Margo--

As Gru turns to Margo he sees that she is holding hands with
Antonio, face-to-face, almost close enough to kiss.

                    ANTONIO
          Hello, Mr. Gru.

Gru furrows his brow.

                      GRU
          Aghhh!    Okay...

He grabs Antonio and drags him far away from Margo.

                       MARGO
          Gru!

                    GRU
          There must be the standard six feet
          of space between you and boys.
              (re: Antonio)
          Especially this boy.

Gru turns and sees that Antonio is back next to Margo.

                    ANTONIO
              (laughs)
          You are a funny man. There are no

EXT: EDUARDO'S HOUSE - LATER

Gru, sneaking through the party, spots Antonio and Margo
dancing.

Gru sneaks up on Antonio, using the flashing strobe lights to
cover his approach. Suddenly Antonio is gone and Gru is the
one dancing with Margo, who has her back to him and is
oblivious to what's going on.

Antonio reappears and kicks Gru in the crotch from behind.
He dances once again with Margo while Gru hunches over in
pain.

Gru then gets the upper hand and starts choking Antonio and
shaking him. Margo turns around and sees this.

Gru and Antonio see they are being watched by Margo and start
casually dancing next to each other as if nothing is wrong.

As the song ends, Margo takes Antonio's hand and pulls him
away from Gru off the dance floor.

Gru is defeated and all alone.


INT: EDUARDO'S HOUSE - LATER

Gru sits by himself in the corner, sulking and staring at
Lucy's lipstick taser. A WAITER walks by and places a
tortilla chip sombrero on his head with the rim filled with
guacamole. He breaks off a piece, dips it, and eats it.

                    EDUARDO (O.S.)
          So glad you could make it, mi
          compadre.

Gru looks up and sees Eduardo standing there.   Gru quickly
hides the taser.

                    EDUARDO (CONT'D)
              (sensing something's
               wrong)
          Hey, what's wrong?

                    GRU
          Oh, nothing. Nothing is wrong.
          I'm just chilling with the
          guac...from my chip hat.

Gru takes another scoop of guacamole, smiles, and gives a
thumbs up. A glob of guacamole falls from the sombrero.
Eduardo puts his arm around him.

          too well. It is the look of a
          broken heart.

                    GRU
          How did you know?

                    EDUARDO
          Believe me, my friend, I too have
          spent many nights trying to drown
          my sorrows in guacamole.

                    GRU
          You?

                    EL MACHO
          Yes. But we are survivors.
          There's much more to us than meets
          the eye. Enjoy the party.

Eduardo gives Gru a meaningful look. And then walks away.
Gru watches him go. Deep in thought.

Gru notices Eduardo suspiciously sneak away from the party
and head into the house.

Gru gets up from the table and follows Eduardo. As he walks
through the party, several partygoers break tortilla pieces
off his sombrero to eat.


INT: EDUARDO HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Eduardo enters a dimly-lit room. Gru sneaks behind and peers
through a crack in the door.


INT: SECRET MAYAN ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Eduardo stands in the center of a secret room, which is lined
with Mayan-style totem poles. He dances on the tile floor,
which lights up and plays "La Cucaracha" with each strategic
step.

The musical pattern is a code which opens a secret passageway
through the largest totem's mouth. Eduardo enters and the
mouth closes behind him.

Gru tentatively enters the room. He pauses at the tile
floor. He tries to replicate Eduardo's "La Cucaracha" code,
but a glob of guacamole from his sombrero falls to the floor
and hits the wrong tile. This activates a booby-trapped
totem pole, which halves Gru's sombrero with a spear.

Gru observes the destroyed sombrero in his hands.

                       GRU (CONT'D)
          Huh.

Gru attempts the code again, but missteps.    An axe from the
wall swings at him and misses.

                       GRU (CONT'D)
          Oooh!

Gru missteps again and one of the totems lights up and spits
fire at him, burning his face.

                     GRU (CONT'D)
              (dazed)
          Aaaahhh...

He missteps again and a club whacks him over the head.

                       GRU (CONT'D)
          Oh!

One of the totems shoots darts at him, piercing his nose.

                    GRU (CONT'D)
              (in pain)
          Aaaahhh!

Gru falls to the floor.

                       GRU (CONT'D)
          Oooohhh.

His head hits the correct tile, and the Mayan passageway
opens. Gru walks to the door, pointing at the totems and
gloating.

                      GRU (CONT'D)
          Aha!    Ha ha ha--

The passageway doors slam on his arm.

Lucy sits alone and stares out the window.    Depressed.   She
SIGHS.

She grabs an in flight magazine and opens it up to an ad for
wristwatches. It reads; "IN THE SKY, HE IS THE ONE MAN
EVERYONE CAN TRUST" and shows a picture of Gru giving the
thumbs up in a cockpit.

                       LUCY
          Say what?

Lucy reacts, shakes her head, and now the picture is just a
regular airline pilot in the cockpit.

Lucy turns the page. It's another ad, saying simply "Gru
Now!" and showing a picture of a muscular Gru diving from a
waterfall. She GASPS and slams the magazine shut, then
slowly reopens it to find the picture is really just a random
muscular guy diving. It says "GO NOW - TO HAWAII!"

                    FLIGHT ATTENDANT (O.S.)
          Would you like some peanuts or
          pretzels?

Lucy looks up from her magazine to see the flight attendant,
who looks like Gru. She REACTS. Then looks across the aisle
and sees a lady that looks and sounds like Gru, talking to
another man who looks like Gru.

                    FEMALE GRU PASSENGER
          Ha ha ha ha ha! That's a good

Then Lucy looks behind her and sees the young mother looks
like Gru. The baby turns around and also looks like Gru.

The flight attendant stands up, recovering from her twirl.

                    FLIGHT ATTENDANT
          You're welcome!

The other passengers wave as the plane's oxygen masks fall
from each overhead console. And with that, Lucy jumps from
the plane, holding her purse.

As Lucy falls from the sky she presses a button on her purse

           now...I just need to get some
           things off my plate before we start

           No--no, forget it! One hundred

                something)
           I think--what is--do you hear that--
           I do. That's Agnes calling me from

Gru steps into the elevator and the door shuts. Then opens.
He's frantically trying to press the button that will return
him to the surface.

                     GRU (CONT'D)
           Totally in!

The doors close and Gru is gone.       El Macho stares, deep in
thought. Clearly suspicious.

                     EL MACHO
           You know what? I am not so
           convinced that he is in.

El Macho presses a button that releases the Purple Minion.

Edith takes off her blindfold.

          Sorry.

          But I didn't get a turn!


EXT: OTHER SIDE OF EL MACHO'S HOUSE - DAY

Margo sits at a table alone and depressed, wearing the chip
hat. She looks like she's been crying.

                    GRU
          Margo!

Gru approaches her with the other girls in tow.

                    GRU (CONT'D)
          Come on, we're leav--hey, what's
          wrong?

                    MARGO
          I hate boys.

Gru turns and sees Antonio dancing with a PRETTY GIRL.   Gru
frowns.

                    GRU
          Yes...they stink.   Sorry, honey,
          we've got to go.

He takes her hand and leads her offscreen before popping back
into frame and firing the freeze ray at Antonio. We see he
is now frozen in a block of ice.

Lucy looks around, but doesn't see Gru.   She maneuvers her
way through the crowd.

                    LUCY
          Oops, sorry!

She makes it through, but still no sign of Gru.

Suddenly Pollito appears and exchanges looks with Lucy. He
SCREECHES and flies towards her. She strikes a martial arts
pose ready to defend herself. As she does, her purse falls
to the ground.

The attack never comes and she looks down to see Pollito
pecking at her purse.

                     EL MACHO (O.S.)
          Pollito!   What's the matter?

El Macho appears and picks up the chicken, petting it.

                     LUCY
          Oh, hey!   Eduardo!

                    EL MACHO
          Lucia! I apologize. Pollito, he's
          usually not like this. The same
          thing happened the other day
          with... with Gru and...

El Macho drops off, deep in thought.   Connecting the dots.
Lucy is oblivious.

                    LUCY
          Oh, speaking of Gru...uh, have you
          seen him? I really need to talk to
          him.

                    EL MACHO
          Yes, I think he's somewhere around
          here. You two are close, no?

                    LUCY
          Oh, I don't know. I mean close...
          I wouldn't say we were close. Why,

          It's more what he didn't say. For
          instance, he never mentioned...that
          you were both working for the Anti-
          Villain League!!!

Suddenly El Macho turns Pollito around revealing that he has
her AVL credentials in his beak. El Macho grabs Lucy.

                    EL MACHO (CONT'D)
              (threateningly)
          You're coming with me.

He leads her away.

                       LUCY
          Hey!

We see Dr. Nefario watching this, in shock.      He's holding a
drink and a Mexican flag cupcake.

          Crikey.

The vehicle pulls into the driveway.


INT: GRU'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Gru walks the girls into the family room. Two minions sit in
front of the big screen TV playing a video game.

                    EDITH
          So Eduardo's actually El Macho?
          Cool!

                    GRU
          No, it is not cool. Plus, I pretty
          much knew it was him all along, so
          if anyone's cool, it's me.

The BIGSCREEN TV BEEPS. Gru and the others turn to look.
It's Dr. Nefario. He's at El Macho's, whispering and looking
anxiously around him from under a table.

                       DR. NEFARIO (ON SCREEN)

          El Macho's on to you. He knows
          you're working for the AVL. And
          he's got your partner!

Gru is confused.

                    GRU
          Lucy? Wha--that's impossible!
          She's on her way to Australia...

                     EL MACHO (O.S.)
          Nefario!

Dr. Nefario looks nervously offscreen.    El Macho's coming.

                    DR. NEFARIO (ON SCREEN)
          Sorry, gotta go!

Nefario disconnects the camera.   The screen goes blank.

Agnes GASPS and turns to Gru.

                    AGNES
          He's got Lucy?

                    GRU
              (determined)
          Not for long.

Gru begins to walk out of the room.    He turns to the minions.

          Come on.

          We're getting her out of there.

Gru marches out of the room, fire in his eyes.    A man on a
mission. To save the woman he loves.

The minions are visibly disappointed to leave their video
game. One of them clutches the controller in his hand and
continues to play until the moment he exits the frame.

holding on.

He speeds down the road.    Ready to kick some butt.


EXT: EL MACHO'S COMPOUND - DAY

The yard is now filled with ROCKET SHIPS.

From behind, we watch El Macho emerge from his home to survey

Some minions file into the rocket ships.    El Macho watches
them and LAUGHS maniacally.

EVIL MINION POV: The evil minion Kevin runs down the street,
nearing Gru's house. He is scared by his own reflection in a

Kyle runs off and evil minion Kevin gives chase.   He stops
when he sees the front door.

Margo and Agnes sit on the floor playing a princess board

They hear a SCRATCHING SOUND outside the window.   Agnes looks
scared.

          What was that?

Margo stands up. Makes her way toward the window, which is
covered with drapes. Then reaches a nervous hand and pulls
back the drapes.

lands in the family room surrounded by shattered glass and
tangled up in the curtain. He turns to the girls, who slowly
back away. He looks at Agnes and ROARS.

                       MARGO (CONT'D)
          Run!

Margo grabs Agnes and they run out of the room, accidentally
dropping the stuffed unicorn behind.

Agnes stops and runs back for it.

Agnes stops and sees evil minion Kevin already has it in his
mouth.

Agnes screams a crazy HIGH-PITCHED SCREAM. It SHATTERS all
the glass in the room, including the glass in evil minion
Kevin's goggles. He spits out the unicorn. He is slowed him
down for a bit, so Agnes safely grabs the unicorn, and Margo
grabs Agnes's hand.

They run for the elevator to the lower level, with the purple
minion hot on their tails.   The elevator drops just in time.
Evil minion Kevin slams into the glass door.

It drops down into the lab and lands on a dazed yellow

them.

Evil minion Kevin stomps toward the girls.    They are backed
into a corner. It's all over.

Then suddenly a HYPODERMIC NEEDLE enters frame and injects
evil minion Kevin. He falls over, writhing on the floor.
Then he sits up and--

Has turned back into a YELLOW MINION.    It's Kevin!

Gru makes his way up the road leading to El Macho's house.
He is wearing handcuffs, and being led at spear-point by Dave

still have a few yellow spots.

The minions somber up.

                    MINIONS
          Okay, okay.

Gru covers a smeared yellow spot with purple paint.

They approach the front gate, which is closed. Dave boosts
himself onto a stray box and speaks gibberish into the
intercom. He hears Evil Minion gibberish in response. He
responds back in Evil Minion gibberish.

The intercom buzzes and the gate begins to open.

The gate opens and there are DOZENS of PURPLE MINIONS milling
about. They eye Gru and his captors suspiciously.

Dave and Stuart poke Gru with a spear.

          Curses. Foiled again. These guys

The Evil Minions CHEER at seeing this.

Gru, Dave and Stuart have to walk all the way to the house
surrounded on all sides by evil purple minions. The painted
yellow minions are very nervous. The purple minions eye them
as they pass. They GROWL and the yellow minions attempt to
GROWL back.

It's extremely intense, but it looks like they're going to
make it.

Then one of the evil minions makes a slobbery raspberry at
one of the painted ones. They get into a raspberry fight
until the painted minion is grossed out and tries to rub the
slobber off him. It rubs off the purple paint.

One of the evil purple minions points and SCREAMS. They're
exposed! All of the purple minions run towards Gru, Dave and
Stuart. Teeth bared. Ready to chomp.

Gru and the yellow minions burst into El Macho's backyard.
The Evil Minions give chase.

                    GRU
          Up that tree! Hurry, hurry!

They climb a tree up to the roof of the house, only to be
pursued by more minions up there. And the Evil Minions have
devoured the tree so they can't go back that way either.

With no escape, Gru and the minions run up a tower until they
reach the top--a dead end.

Here come the purple minions. They're trapped. Gru kicks
them away and the yellow minions try to fight off the purple
ones. But they are clearly doomed.

And then Gru's ship appears hovering above them! Modified as
a jelly-dispensing weapon and with Dr. Nefario at the
controls! The minions hang on the sides holding JELLY
BLASTERS.

The ship opens fire on the evil minions, transforming them.
POP! POP! POP! POP! One by one they transform back into
yellow minions. One of the Minions wipes the horrible
tasting jelly off his tongue.

Dr. Nefario sticks his head out the side of the ship.

          Hello, Gru!

                      GRU

Gru leaps onto the ship.

          Hi!

Gru is flabbergasted.    He turns to Nefario.

                    GRU
          You brought the girls?

                       DR. NEFARIO
          Yes!
                 (beat)
          Oh.     Was that wrong?

Gru's ship flies toward El Macho, blasting purple minions all
along the way.

From behind a large jelly gun Edith unloads round after
round.

                      EDITH
          Wooooo!    Yeeeaaahhh!

El Macho witnesses his evil minions being converted back to
regular ones.

                      EL MACHO
          Oh no! What's happening to my
          minions?
               (beat)
          Gru?

Gru turns to Nefario and the girls.

                     GRU
          You guys take care of the rest of
          the minions.
              (beat)
          I'm going to find Lucy.

Gru leaps out of the ship down to the roof El Macho is on.
He has two big jelly weapons in his hands.

Meanwhile the ship flies off with its jelly blasters firing,
and comes to land on the ground below.

The minions and the girls start jumping from the ship.    Agnes
takes aim.

                    AGNES

         DESPICABLE ME 2           CINCO & KEN DRAFT     95.


Agnes' gun is a little too big for her and the kick sends her
a bit out of control. But she still manages to hit a number
of Evil Minions. The tide is turning.

Meanwhile, Gru has gone ballistic on the evil minions.   BLAM!
BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! He takes the remaining few out.

El Macho kicks an evil minion at Gru, but he manages to hit
it with jelly and transform it back to yellow. Gru holds his
gun up to El Macho and gives him a threatening look.

                    GRU
          It's over, El Macho.   Now where is
          Lucy?

                    EL MACHO
              (chuckles)
          Let me show you.

He turns to a computer and pushes a button.

A fountain stops spewing water and underneath it STEEL DOORS
open from the ground. And out of them rises a ROCKET.
Strapped to it is Lucy. Tied to a SHARK with TWO HUNDRED AND
FIFTY POUNDS OF DYNAMITE strapped to her.

Gru is horrified.   He GASPS.

                     LUCY
          Oh, hey Gru! Turns out you were
          right about the whole El Macho
          thing, huh?
               (unconvincingly)
          Yay!

El Macho calls to Gru, brandishing a remote.

                    EL MACHO
          One push of this button and I send
          that rocket straight into the same
          volcano where I faked my death.
          Only this time--it's for real!

                      GRU
                (horrified)
          No!

Dave swoops in on a rope and grabs the remote, Tarzan-

          Tally ho!
         DESPICABLE ME 2            CINCO & KEN DRAFT    96.


But unfortunately he smacks a roof support and drops the
remote. It bonks a bunch of minions on the head and lands on
the ground.

El Macho stares down Gru.   Fire in his eyes.

                     EL MACHO
          We could've ruled the world
          together, Gru. But now--you're
          gonna die.

He pulls out a vial of PX-41 and drinks it. Gru GASPS. El
Macho transforms into a giant, purple, furry creature. He
ROARS.

Gru pulls the trigger on his jelly gun, but he is out of
ammunition. He then pulls out the FREEZE RAY and fires,
encasing El Macho's fists in blocks of ice. El Macho GROWLS
and slams his fists to the ground, shattering the ice and
knocking Gru off the platform and onto a scaffolding. Gru
SCREAMS.

The scaffolding tips over. El Macho grabs the scaffolding
and holds it above his head, ready to crush Gru.

Suddenly Gru pulls out Lucy's lipstick taser and fires it at
Purple El Macho! The jolt of electricity has him shaking and
dancing and ultimately sizzling and smoking, until he finally
collapses on the ground.

                    GRU
          Lipstick taser!

Lucy smiles at this.

                    LUCY
          Aw...he copied me.

Gru runs off to save her.   The minions surround El Macho,
cocking their jelly guns.

                    EL MACHO
              (dazed)
          I am not afraid of your jelly guns.

                    DR. NEFARIO
          Oh, this ain't a jelly gun,
          sunshine.

Dr. Nefario fires the Fart Gun directly into El Macho's face,
causing him to pass out. The minions CHEER, firing their
jelly guns into the air.

One of the minions stands on top of El Macho and poses for a
big game hunter-style photo. Dr. Nefario smiles for the
camera as well.

Gru runs toward the rocket.

                     LUCY
          Don't worry about me, Gru! I'll be
          fine. I have survived lots worse
          than this.
              (beat)
          Okay, that's not entirely true.
          I'm actually kind of freaking out
          up here!

                    GRU
          Don't worry--I will get you out of
          this!

Gru attempts to untie Lucy. And then sees Pollito has walked
over to the remote. Gru and Lucy GASP. The chicken looks at
Gru and Lucy, then pecks the button.

                    GRU (CONT'D)
          I really hate that chicken.

The rocket blasts off into the air. The Minions and Girls
watch in horror as Gru and Lucy fly off on the rocket.


EXT: SKY - CONTINUOUS

Gru uses his knife to cut Lucy's ropes. They SCREAM as the
shark gets loose and falls down to a SUSHI BAR below where
all of the CUSTOMERS and SUSHI CHEF CHEER.

Meanwhile, on the rocket Gru rips a panel off the side,
revealing a mess of WIRES inside.

                    LUCY
          Is there a red one?   It's usually
          the red one.

Gru starts to pull out wires left and right.   To no avail.

                    LUCY (CONT'D)
          Gru, anytime now!

Gru GASPS, realizing they are approaching the VOLCANO. Time
is running out. Death is imminent. He looks Lucy in the
eyes.

                     GRU
           Listen, Lucy--we may not get out of
           this alive, so I need to ask you a
           question.

                     LUCY
           Uh, better make it quick!

                     GRU
           If I'd asked you out on a date,
           what would you have said?

                     LUCY
           Are you kidding me?!   Yes!

Gru smiles. Then realizes that the rocket is still careening
toward the volcano. He grabs Lucy.

                       GRU
           JUMP!!!

Gru and Lucy grab hands and leap off the rocket.

The rocket plunges into the volcano.

Gru and Lucy plummet through the air.

KA-BLAAAAM!!! The volcano explodes in a massive tempest of
fire and smoke and lava.

The impact of the blast hits Gru and Lucy and sends them
flying.

SPLASH!   They hit the water.

BAM!   BOOM!   The volcano continues exploding.

SPLASH! Gru emerges, soaking and out of breath.     Fire and
lava flying all around him. He can't find Lucy.

                      GRU (CONT'D)
           Oh!  Lucy!
               (looks around, panicking)
           Lucy! Where are you?!

After a few moments, Lucy also emerges.    Gru is incredibly
relieved.

                       GRU (CONT'D)
           Oh, Lucy!

                       LUCY

Lucy smiles and hugs Gru. They both go underwater.       Then
come back up. Sputtering. And in love.

                    LUCY (CONT'D)
          Sorry...I guess you kind of need
          your arms to tread water, huh?

The Minions appear in the rowboat.

                    TOM
              ("Stroke!")
          Mack-oh! Mack-oh!      Mack-oh!

But they pass right by them.

                    GRU
          They'll be back...

TITLE CARD: 147 DATES LATER...

Romantic music plays under the title card.


EXT: HILLSIDE - DAY

Four minions, dressed in matching suits, begin to sing a All-
4-One's "I Swear," pronounced "Underwear" in Minionese.

We are at Gru and Lucy's wedding reception. We PULL BACK to
the WEDDING CAKE, and then to Gru and Lucy dancing. As they
dance we see all of the wedding guests watching: Gru's Mom,
Dr. Nefario, Silas, Jillian, Shannon, Natalie, etc.

Gru dips Lucy and they attempt their kiss, but their noses
keep bumping. They finally manage to kiss and the crowd
CHEERS.

We see the three girls watching in their beautiful bridesmaid
dresses. Agnes can barely contain her glee. PAN OVER TO
Edith, who makes a face.

                    EDITH
          Can I be the first to say--ewwww!

The minions finish the song.

The girls sit at their table.    Agnes clearly has something on
her mind. She SIGHS.

                      AGNES
          Okay.

She stands up on the table.
        DESPICABLE ME 2             CINCO & KEN DRAFT    100.


                       AGNES (CONT'D)
          Excuse me!

Looks out at the crowd, but they can't hear her.

                     AGNES (CONT'D)
          Um...hi!   Excuse me!

She still doesn't have the crowd's attention, so Margo taps
on her glass. Everyone looks to Agnes, who is visibly
nervous.

                    AGNES (CONT'D)
          Uh...hi, everybody! I'd like to
          make some toast. Uh...

She looks out at the crowd. Is really nervous. Looks over
at Gru. He smiles. Mouths "okay." This helps, and Agnes
pulls herself together and recites the Mothers Day poem from
earlier.

                    AGNES (CONT'D)
          She um...she um, kisses my boo-boos.
          She braids my hair.
          We love you mothers, everywhere!

Agnes turns to Lucy and looks her right in the eyes.

                    AGNES (CONT'D)
          And my new mom Lucy is beyond
          compare.

Lucy smiles, melting. The crowd goes "awwwww." Agnes and
Lucy spin around in a hug. The crowd cheers and applauds.
Gru, Margo and Edith join Agnes and Lucy in a group hug. The
family is complete.

                    AGNES (CONT'D)
          To the bride and Gru!

A minion begins to spin The Village People's "YMCA" at the DJ
table. The minions, several of whom are dressed as The
Village People, begin to perform the song. The minion
dressed as the Chiquita banana lady also joins in.

Then the entire family boogies across the dance floor,
including Dr. Nefario and Gru's Mom.

                    AGNES (CONT'D)
          I'M SO HAAAAPPPPYYYYYYY!!!!

According to all known laws of aviation, there is no way that a bee should be able to fly. Its wings are too small to get its fat little body off the ground. The bee, of course, flies anyway. Because bees don’t care what humans think is impossible.” SEQ. 75 - “INTRO TO BARRY” INT. BENSON HOUSE - DAY ANGLE ON: Sneakers on the ground. Camera PANS UP to reveal BARRY BENSON’S BEDROOM ANGLE ON: Barry’s hand flipping through different sweaters in his closet. BARRY Yellow black, yellow black, yellow black, yellow black, yellow black, yellow black...oohh, black and yellow... ANGLE ON: Barry wearing the sweater he picked, looking in the mirror. BARRY (CONT’D) Yeah, let’s shake it up a little. He picks the black and yellow one. He then goes to the sink, takes the top off a CONTAINER OF HONEY, and puts some honey into his hair. He squirts some in his mouth and gargles. Then he takes the lid off the bottle, and rolls some on like deodorant. CUT TO: INT. BENSON HOUSE KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS Barry’s mother, JANET BENSON, yells up at Barry. JANET BENSON Barry, breakfast is ready! CUT TO: "Bee Movie" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 1. INT. BARRY’S ROOM - CONTINUOUS BARRY Coming! SFX: Phone RINGING. Barry’s antennae vibrate as they RING like a phone. Barry’s hands are wet. He looks around for a towel. BARRY (CONT’D) Hang on a second! He wipes his hands on his sweater, and pulls his antennae down to his ear and mouth. BARRY (CONT'D) Hello? His best friend, ADAM FLAYMAN, is on the other end. ADAM Barry? BARRY Adam? ADAM Can you believe this is happening? BARRY Can’t believe it. I’ll pick you up. Barry sticks his stinger in a sharpener. SFX: BUZZING AS HIS STINGER IS SHARPENED. He tests the sharpness with his finger. SFX: Bing. BARRY (CONT’D) Looking sharp. ANGLE ON: Barry hovering down the hall, sliding down the staircase bannister. Barry’s mother, JANET BENSON, is in the kitchen. JANET BENSON Barry, why don’t you use the stairs? Your father paid good money for those. "Bee Movie" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 2. BARRY Sorry, I’m excited. Barry’s father, MARTIN BENSON, ENTERS. He’s reading a NEWSPAPER with the HEADLINE, “Queen gives birth to thousandtuplets: Resting Comfortably.” MARTIN BENSON Here’s the graduate. We’re very proud of you, Son. And a perfect report card, all B’s. JANET BENSON (mushing Barry’s hair) Very proud. BARRY Ma! I’ve got a thing going here. Barry re-adjusts his hair, starts to leave. JANET BENSON You’ve got some lint on your fuzz. She picks it off. BARRY Ow, that’s me! MARTIN BENSON Wave to us. We’ll be in row 118,000. Barry zips off. BARRY Bye! JANET BENSON Barry, I told you, stop flying in the house! CUT TO: SEQ. 750 - DRIVING TO GRADUATION EXT. BEE SUBURB - MORNING A GARAGE DOOR OPENS. Barry drives out in his CAR. "Bee Movie" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 3. ANGLE ON: Barry’s friend, ADAM FLAYMAN, standing by the curb. He’s reading a NEWSPAPER with the HEADLINE: “Frisbee Hits Hive: Internet Down. Bee-stander: “I heard a sound, and next thing I knew...wham-o!.” Barry drives up, stops in front of Adam. Adam jumps in. BARRY Hey, Adam. ADAM Hey, Barry. (pointing at Barry’s hair) Is that fuzz gel? BARRY A little. It’s a special day. Finally graduating. ADAM I never thought I’d make it. BARRY Yeah, three days of grade school, three days of high school. ADAM Those were so awkward. BARRY Three days of college. I’m glad I took off one day in the middle and just hitchhiked around the hive. ADAM You did come back different. They drive by a bee who’s jogging. ARTIE Hi Barry! BARRY (to a bee pedestrian) Hey Artie, growing a mustache? Looks good. Barry and Adam drive from the suburbs into the city. ADAM Hey, did you hear about Frankie? "Bee Movie" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 4. BARRY Yeah. ADAM You going to his funeral? BARRY No, I’m not going to his funeral. Everybody knows you sting someone you die, you don’t waste it on a squirrel. He was such a hot head. ADAM Yeah, I guess he could’ve just gotten out of the way. The DRIVE through a loop de loop. BARRY AND ADAM Whoa...Whooo...wheee!! ADAM I love this incorporating the amusement park right into our regular day. BARRY I guess that’s why they say we don’t need vacations. CUT TO: SEQ. 95 - GRADUATION EXT. GRADUATION CEREMONY - CONTINUOUS Barry and Adam come to a stop. They exit the car, and fly over the crowd to their seats. * BARRY * (re: graduation ceremony) * Boy, quite a bit of pomp...under * the circumstances. * They land in their seats. BARRY (CONT’D) Well Adam, today we are men. "Bee Movie" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 5. ADAM We are. BARRY Bee-men. ADAM Amen! BARRY Hallelujah. Barry hits Adam’s forehead. Adam goes into the rapture. An announcement comes over the PA. ANNOUNCER (V.O) Students, faculty, distinguished bees...please welcome, Dean Buzzwell. ANGLE ON: DEAN BUZZWELL steps up to the podium. The podium has a sign that reads: “Welcome Graduating Class of:”, with train-station style flipping numbers after it. BUZZWELL Welcome New Hive City graduating class of... The numbers on the podium change to 9:15. BUZZWELL (CONT’D) ...9:15. (he clears his throat) And that concludes our graduation ceremonies. And begins your career at Honex Industries. BARRY Are we going to pick our job today? ADAM I heard it’s just orientation. The rows of chairs change in transformer-like mechanical motion to Universal Studios type tour trams. Buzzwell walks off stage. BARRY (re: trams) Whoa, heads up! Here we go. "Bee Movie" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 6. SEQ. 125 - “FACTORY” FEMALE VOICE (V.O) Keep your hands and antennas inside the tram at all times. (in Spanish) Dejen las manos y antennas adentro del tram a todos tiempos. BARRY I wonder what it’s going to be like? ADAM A little scary. Barry shakes Adam. BARRY AND ADAM AAHHHH! The tram passes under SIGNS READING: “Honex: A Division of Honesco: A Part of the Hexagon Group.” TRUDY Welcome to Honex, a division of Honesco, and a part of the Hexagon group. BARRY This is it! The Honex doors OPEN, revealing the factory. BARRY (CONT’D) Wow. TRUDY We know that you, as a bee, have worked your whole life to get to the point where you can work for your whole life. Honey begins when our valiant pollen jocks bring the nectar to the hive where our top secret formula is automatically color-corrected, scent adjusted and bubble contoured into this... Trudy GRABS a TEST TUBE OF HONEY from a technician. "Bee Movie" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 7. TRUDY (CONT’D) ...soothing, sweet syrup with its distinctive golden glow, you all know as... EVERYONE ON THE TRAM (in unison) H-o-n-e-y. Trudy flips the flask into the crowd, and laughs as they all scramble for it. ANGLE ON: A GIRL BEE catching the honey. ADAM (sotto) That girl was hot. BARRY (sotto) She’s my cousin. ADAM She is? BARRY Yes, we’re all cousins. ADAM Right. You’re right. TRUDY At Honex, we also constantly strive to improve every aspect of bee existence. These bees are stress testing a new helmet technology. ANGLE ON: A STUNT BEE in a HELMET getting hit with a NEWSPAPER, then a SHOE, then a FLYSWATTER. He gets up, and gives a “thumb’s up”. The graduate bees APPLAUD. ADAM (re: stunt bee) What do you think he makes? BARRY Not enough. TRUDY And here we have our latest advancement, the Krelman. "Bee Movie" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 8. BARRY Wow, what does that do? TRUDY Catches that little strand of honey that hangs after you pour it. Saves us millions. ANGLE ON: The Krelman machine. Bees with hand-shaped hats on, rotating around a wheel to catch drips of honey. Adam’s hand shoots up. ADAM Can anyone work on the Krelman? TRUDY Of course. Most bee jobs are small ones. But bees know that every small job, if it’s done well, means a lot. There are over 3000 different bee occupations. But choose carefully, because you’ll stay in the job that you pick for the rest of your life. The bees CHEER. ANGLE ON: Barry’s smile dropping slightly. BARRY The same job for the rest of your life? I didn’t know that. ADAM What’s the difference? TRUDY And you’ll be happy to know that bees as a species haven’t had one day off in 27 million years. BARRY So you’ll just work us to death? TRUDY (laughing) We’ll sure try. Everyone LAUGHS except Barry. "Bee Movie" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 9. The tram drops down a log-flume type steep drop. Cameras flash, as all the bees throw up their hands. The frame freezes into a snapshot. Barry looks concerned. The tram continues through 2 doors. FORM DISSOLVE TO: SEQ. 175 - “WALKING THE HIVE” INT. HONEX LOBBY ANGLE ON: The log-flume photo, as Barry looks at it. ADAM Wow. That blew my mind. BARRY (annoyed) “What’s the difference?” Adam, how could you say that? One job forever? That’s an insane choice to have to make. ADAM Well, I’m relieved. Now we only have to make one decision in life. BARRY But Adam, how could they never have told us that? ADAM Barry, why would you question anything? We’re bees. We’re the most perfectly functioning society on Earth. They walk by a newspaper stand with A SANDWICH BOARD READING: “Bee Goes Berserk: Stings Seven Then Self.” ANGLE ON: A BEE filling his car’s gas tank from a honey pump. He fills his car some, then takes a swig for himself. NEWSPAPER BEE (to the bee guzzling gas) Hey! Barry and Adam begin to cross the street. "Bee Movie" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 10. BARRY Yeah but Adam, did you ever think that maybe things work a little too well around here? They stop in the middle of the street. The traffic moves perfectly around them. ADAM Like what? Give me one example. BARRY (thinks) ...I don’t know. But you know what I’m talking about. They walk off. SEQ. 400 - “MEET THE JOCKS” SFX: The SOUND of Pollen Jocks. PAN DOWN from the Honex statue. J-GATE ANNOUNCER Please clear the gate. Royal Nectar Force on approach. Royal Nectar Force on approach. BARRY Wait a second. Check it out. Hey, hey, those are Pollen jocks. ADAM Wow. FOUR PATROL BEES FLY in through the hive’s giant Gothic entrance. The Patrol Bees are wearing fighter pilot helmets with black visors. ADAM (CONT’D) I’ve never seen them this close. BARRY They know what it’s like to go outside the hive. ADAM Yeah, but some of them don’t come back. "Bee Movie" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 11. The nectar from the pollen jocks is removed from their backpacks, and loaded into trucks on their way to Honex. A SMALL CROWD forms around the Patrol Bees. Each one has a PIT CREW that takes their nectar. Lou Loduca hurries a pit crew along: LOU LODUCA You guys did great! You’re monsters. You’re sky freaks! I love it! I love it! SCHOOL GIRLS are jumping up and down and squealing nearby. BARRY I wonder where those guys have just been? ADAM I don’t know. BARRY Their day’s not planned. Outside the hive, flying who-knows-where, doing who-knows-what. ADAM You can’t just decide one day to be a Pollen Jock. You have to be bred for that. BARRY Right. Pollen Jocks cross in close proximity to Barry and Adam. Some pollen falls off, onto Barry and Adam. BARRY (CONT’D) Look at that. That’s more pollen than you and I will ever see in a lifetime. ADAM (playing with the pollen) It’s just a status symbol. I think bees make too big a deal out of it. BARRY Perhaps, unless you’re wearing it, and the ladies see you wearing it. ANGLE ON: Two girl bees. "Bee Movie" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 12. ADAM Those ladies? Aren’t they our cousins too? BARRY Distant, distant. ANGLE ON: TWO POLLEN JOCKS. JACKSON Look at these two. SPLITZ Couple of Hive Harrys. JACKSON Let’s have some fun with them. The pollen jocks approach. Barry and Adam continue to talk to the girls. GIRL 1 It must be so dangerous being a pollen jock. BARRY Oh yeah, one time a bear had me pinned up against a mushroom. He had one paw on my throat, and with the other he was slapping me back and forth across the face. GIRL 1 Oh my. BARRY I never thought I’d knock him out. GIRL 2 (to Adam) And what were you doing during all of this? ADAM Obviously I was trying to alert the authorities. The girl swipes some pollen off of Adam with a finger. BARRY (re: pollen) I can autograph that if you want. "Bee Movie" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 13. JACKSON Little gusty out there today, wasn’t it, comrades? BARRY Yeah. Gusty. BUZZ You know, we’re going to hit a sunflower patch about six miles from here tomorrow. BARRY Six miles, huh? ADAM (whispering) Barry. BUZZ It’s a puddle-jump for us. But maybe you’re not up for it. BARRY Maybe I am. ADAM (whispering louder) You are not! BUZZ We’re going, oh-nine hundred at JGate. ADAM (re: j-gate) Whoa. BUZZ (leaning in, on top of Barry) What do you think, Buzzy Boy? Are you bee enough? BARRY I might be. It all depends on what oh-nine hundred means. CUT TO: SEQ. 450 - “THE BALCONY” "Bee Movie" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 14. INT. BENSON HOUSE BALCONY - LATER Barry is standing on the balcony alone, looking out over the city. Martin Benson ENTERS, sneaks up behind Barry and gooses him in his ribs. MARTIN BENSON Honex! BARRY Oh, Dad. You surprised me. MARTIN BENSON (laughing) Have you decided what you’re interested in, Son? BARRY Well, there’s a lot of choices. MARTIN BENSON But you only get one. Martin LAUGHS. BARRY Dad, do you ever get bored doing the same job every day? MARTIN BENSON Son, let me tell you something about stirring. (making the stirring motion) You grab that stick and you just move it around, and you stir it around. You get yourself into a rhythm, it’s a beautiful thing. BARRY You know dad, the more I think about it, maybe the honey field just isn’t right for me. MARTIN BENSON And you were thinking of what, making balloon animals? That’s a bad job for a guy with a stinger. "Bee Movie" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 15. BARRY Well no... MARTIN BENSON Janet, your son’s not sure he wants to go into honey. JANET BENSON Oh Barry, you are so funny sometimes. BARRY I’m not trying to be funny. MARTIN BENSON You’re not funny, you’re going into honey. Our son, the stirrer. JANET BENSON You’re going to be a stirrer?! BARRY No one’s listening to me. MARTIN BENSON Wait until you see the sticks I have for you. BARRY I can say anything I want right now. I’m going to get an ant tattoo. JANET BENSON Let’s open some fresh honey and celebrate. BARRY Maybe I’ll pierce my thorax! MARTIN BENSON (toasting) To honey! BARRY Shave my antennae! JANET BENSON To honey! "Bee Movie" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 16. BARRY Shack up with a grasshopper, get a gold tooth, and start calling everybody “Dawg.” CUT TO: SEQ. 760 - “JOB PLACEMENT” EXT. HONEX LOBBY - CONTINUOUS ANGLE ON: A BEE BUS STOP. One group of bees stands on the pavement, as another group hovers above them. A doubledecker bus pulls up. The hovering bees get on the top level, and the standing bees get on the bottom. Barry and Adam pull up outside of Honex. ADAM I can’t believe we’re starting work today. BARRY Today’s the day. Adam jumps out of the car. ADAM (O.C) Come on. All the good jobs will be gone. BARRY Yeah, right... ANGLE ON: A BOARD READING: “JOB PLACEMENT BOARD”. Buzzwell, the Bee Processor, is at the counter. Another BEE APPLICANT, SANDY SHRIMPKIN is EXITING. SANDY SHRIMPKIN Is it still available? BUZZWELL Hang on. (he looks at changing numbers on the board) Two left. And...one of them’s yours. Congratulations Son, step to the side please. "Bee Movie" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 17. SANDY SHRIMPKIN Yeah! ADAM (to Sandy, leaving) What did you get? SANDY SHRIMPKIN Picking the crud out.

ADAM Any chance of getting on to the Krelman, Sir? BUZZWELL Sure, you’re on. "Bee Movie" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 18. He plops the KRELMAN HAT onto Adam’s head. ANGLE ON: The job board. THE COLUMNS READ: “OCCUPATION” “POSITIONS AVAILABLE”, and “STATUS”. The middle column has numbers, and the right column has job openings flipping between “open”, “pending”, and “closed”. BUZZWELL (CONT’D) Oh, I’m sorry. The Krelman just closed out. ADAM Oh! He takes the hat off Adam. BUZZWELL Wax Monkey’s always open. The Krelman goes from “Closed” to “Open”. BUZZWELL (CONT’D) And the Krelman just opened up again. ADAM What happened? BUZZWELL Well, whenever a bee dies, that’s an opening. (pointing at the board) See that? He’s dead, dead, another dead one, deady, deadified, two more dead. Dead from the neck up, dead from the neck down. But, that’s life. ANGLE ON: Barry’s disturbed expression.

LOU LODUCA If anyone’s feeling brave, there’s a Korean Deli on 83rd that gets their roses today. BARRY (timidly) Hey guys. BUZZ Well, look at that. SPLITZ Isn’t that the kid we saw yesterday? LOU LODUCA (to Barry) Hold it son, flight deck’s restricted. JACKSON It’s okay Lou, we’re going to take him up. Splitz and Jackson CHUCKLE. LOU LODUCA Really? Feeling lucky, are ya? A YOUNGER SMALLER BEE THAN BARRY, CHET, runs up with a release waiver for Barry to sign. CHET Sign here. Here. Just initial that. Thank you. LOU LODUCA Okay, you got a rain advisory today and as you all know, bees cannot fly in rain. So be careful. As always, (reading off clipboard) watch your brooms, hockey sticks, dogs, birds, bears, and bats. "Bee Movie" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 21. Also, I got a couple reports of root beer being poured on us. Murphy’s in a home because of it, just babbling like a cicada. BARRY That’s awful. LOU LODUCA And a reminder for all you rookies, bee law number one, absolutely no talking to humans. Alright, launch positions! The Jocks get into formation, chanting as they move. LOU LODUCA (CONT’D) Black and Yellow! JOCKS Hello! SPLITZ (to Barry) Are you ready for this, hot shot? BARRY Yeah.

BARRY Scared out of my shorts - CHECK. LOU LODUCA Okay ladies, let’s move it out. Everyone FLIPS their goggles down. Pit crew bees CRANK their wings, and remove the starting blocks. We hear loud HUMMING. "Bee Movie" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 22. LOU LODUCA (CONT'D) LOU LODUCA (CONT’D) Pound those petunia's, you striped stem-suckers! All of you, drain those flowers! A FLIGHT DECK GUY in deep crouch hand-signals them out the archway as the backwash from the bee wings FLUTTERS his jump suit. Barry follows everyone. SEQ. 800 - “FLYING WITH THE JOCKS” The bees climb above tree tops in formation. Barry is euphoric. BARRY Whoa! I’m out! I can’t believe I’m out! So blue. Ha ha ha! (a beat) I feel so fast...and free. (re: kites in the sky) Box kite! Wow! They fly by several bicyclists, and approach a patch of flowers. BARRY (CONT'D) Flowers! SPLITZ This is blue leader. We have roses visual. Bring it around thirty degrees and hold. BARRY (sotto) Roses. JACKSON Thirty degrees, roger, bringing it around. Many pollen jocks break off from the main group. They use their equipment to collect nectar from flowers. Barry flies down to watch the jocks collect the nectar. JOCK Stand to the side kid, it’s got a bit of a kick. The jock fires the gun, and recoils. Barry watches the gun fill up with nectar. "Bee Movie" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 23. BARRY Oh, that is one Nectar Collector. JOCK You ever see pollination up close? BARRY No, Sir. He takes off, and the excess pollen dust falls causing the flowers to come back to life. JOCK (as he pollinates) I pick some pollen up over here, sprinkle it over here, maybe a dash over there, pinch on that one...see that? It’s a little bit of magic, ain’t it? The FLOWERS PERK UP as he pollinates. BARRY Wow. That’s amazing. Why do we do that? JOCK ...that’s pollen power, Kid. More pollen, more flowers, more nectar, more honey for us. BARRY Cool. The Jock WINKS at Barry. Barry rejoins the other jocks in the sky. They swoop in over a pond, kissing the surface. We see their image reflected in the water; they’re really moving. They fly over a fountain. BUZZ I’m picking up a lot of bright yellow, could be daisies. Don’t we need those? SPLITZ Copy that visual. We see what appear to be yellow flowers on a green field. "Bee Movie" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 24. They go into a deep bank and dive. BUZZ Hold on, one of these flowers seems to be on the move. SPLITZ Say again...Are you reporting a moving flower? BUZZ Affirmative. SEQ. 900 - “TENNIS GAME” The pollen jocks land. It is a tennis court with dozens of tennis balls. A COUPLE, VANESSA and KEN, plays tennis. The bees land right in the midst of a group of balls. KEN (O.C) That was on the line! The other bees start walking around amongst the immense, yellow globes. SPLITZ This is the coolest. What is it? They stop at a BALL on a white line and look up at it. JACKSON I don’t know, but I’m loving this color. SPLITZ (smelling tennis ball) Smells good. Not like a flower. But I like it. JACKSON Yeah, fuzzy. BUZZ Chemical-y. JACKSON Careful, guys, it’s a little grabby. Barry LANDS on a ball and COLLAPSES. "Bee Movie" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 25. BARRY Oh my sweet lord of bees. JACKSON Hey, candy brain, get off there! Barry attempts to pulls his legs off, but they stick. BARRY Problem! A tennis shoe and a hand ENTER FRAME. The hand picks up the ball with Barry underneath it. BARRY (CONT'D) Guys! BUZZ This could be bad. JACKSON Affirmative. Vanessa walks back to the service line, BOUNCES the ball. Each time it BOUNCES, the other bees cringe and GASP. ANGLE ON: Barry, terrified. Pure dumb luck, he’s not getting squished. BARRY (with each bounce) Very close...Gonna Hurt...Mamma’s little boy. SPLITZ You are way out of position, rookie. ANGLE ON: Vanessa serving. We see Barry and the ball up against the racket as she brings it back. She tosses the ball into the air; Barry’s eyes widen. The ball is STRUCK, and the rally is on. KEN Coming in at you like a missile! Ken HITS the ball back. Barry feels the g-forces. ANGLE ON: The Pollen Jocks watching Barry pass by them in SLOW MOTION. "Bee Movie" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 26. BARRY (in slow motion) Help me! JACKSON You know, I don't think these are flowers. SPLITZ Should we tell him? JACKSON I think he knows. BARRY (O.S) What is this?! Vanessa HITS a high arcing lob. Ken waits, poised for the return. We see Barry having trouble maneuvering the ball from fatigue. KEN (overly confident) Match point! ANGLE ON: Ken running up. He has a killer look in his eyes. He’s going to hit the ultimate overhead smash. KEN (CONT'D) You can just start packing up Honey, because I believe you’re about to eat it! ANGLE ON: Pollen Jocks. JACKSON Ahem! Ken is distracted by the jock. KEN What? No! He misses badly. The ball rockets into oblivion. Barry is still hanging on. ANGLE ON: Ken, berating himself. KEN (CONT’D) Oh, you cannot be serious. We hear the ball WHISTLING, and Barry SCREAMING. "Bee Movie" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 27. BARRY Yowser!!! SEQ. 1000 - “SUV” The ball flies through the air, and lands in the middle of the street. It bounces into the street again, and sticks in the grille of an SUV. INT. CAR ENGINE - CONTINUOUS BARRY’S POV: the grille of the SUV sucks him up. He tumbles through a black tunnel, whirling vanes, and pistons. BARRY AHHHHHHHHHHH!! OHHHH!! EECHHH!! AHHHHHH!! Barry gets chilled by the A/C system, and sees a frozen grasshopper. BARRY (CONT’D) (re: grasshopper) Eww, gross. CUT TO: INT. CAR - CONTINUOUS The car is packed with a typical suburban family: MOTHER, FATHER, eight-year old BOY, LITTLE GIRL in a car seat and a GRANDMOTHER. A big slobbery DOG is behind a grate. Barry pops into the passenger compartment, hitting the Mother’s magazine. MOTHER There’s a bee in the car! They all notice the bee and start SCREAMING. BARRY Aaahhhh! Barry tumbles around the car. We see the faces from his POV. MOTHER Do something! "Bee Movie" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 28. FATHER I’m driving! Barry flies by the little girl in her CAR SEAT. She waves hello. LITTLE GIRL Hi, bee. SON He’s back here! He’s going to sting me! The car SWERVES around the road. Barry flies into the back, where the slobbery dog SNAPS at him. Barry deftly avoids the jaws and gross, flying SPITTLE. MOTHER Nobody move. If you don’t move, he won’t sting you. Freeze! Everyone in the car freezes. Barry freezes. They stare at each other, eyes going back and forth, waiting to see who will make the first move. Barry blinks. GRANNY He blinked! Granny pulls out a can of HAIR SPRAY. SON Spray him, Granny! Granny sprays the hair spray everywhere. FATHER What are you doing? GRANNY It’s hair spray! Extra hold! MOTHER Kill it! Barry gets sprayed back by the hair spray, then sucked out of the sunroof. CUT TO: "Bee Movie" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 29. EXT. CITY STREET - CONTINUOUS BARRY Wow. The tension level out here is unbelievable. I’ve got to get home. As Barry flies down the street, it starts to RAIN. He nimbly avoids the rain at first. BARRY (CONT’D) Whoa. Whoa! Can’t fly in rain! Can’t fly in rain! Can’t fly in-- A couple of drops hit him, his wings go limp and he starts falling. BARRY (CONT'D) Mayday! Mayday! Bee going down! Barry sees a window ledge and aims for it and just makes it. Shivering and exhausted, he crawls into an open window as it CLOSES. SEQ. 1100 - “VANESSA SAVES BARRY” INT. VANESSA’S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS Inside the window, Barry SHAKES off the rain like a dog. Vanessa, Ken, Andy, and Anna ENTER the apartment. VANESSA Ken, can you close the window please? KEN Huh? Oh. (to Andy) Hey, check out my new resume. I made it into a fold-out brochure. You see? It folds out. Ken holds up his brochure, with photos of himself, and a resume in the middle. ANGLE ON: Barry hiding behind the curtains, as Ken CLOSES THE WINDOW. "Bee Movie" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 30. BARRY Oh no, more humans. I don’t need this. Barry HOVERS up into the air and THROWS himself into the glass. BARRY (CONT’D) (dazed) Ow! What was that? He does it again, and then multiple more times. BARRY (CONT'D) Maybe this time...this time, this time, this time, this time, this time, this time, this time. Barry JUMPS onto the drapes. BARRY (CONT'D) (out of breath) Drapes! (then, re: glass) That is diabolical. KEN It’s fantastic. It’s got all my special skills, even my top ten favorite movies. ANDY What’s your number one? Star Wars? KEN Ah, I don’t go for that, (makes Star Wars noises), kind of stuff. ANGLE ON: Barry. BARRY No wonder we’re not supposed to talk to them. They’re out of their minds. KEN When I walk out of a job interview they’re flabbergasted. They can’t believe the things I say. Barry looks around and sees the LIGHT BULB FIXTURE in the middle of the ceiling. "Bee Movie" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 31. BARRY (re: light bulb) Oh, there’s the sun. Maybe that’s a way out. Barry takes off and heads straight for the light bulb. His POV: The seventy-five watt label grows as he gets closer. BARRY (CONT’D) I don’t remember the sun having a big seventy five on it. Barry HITS the bulb and is KNOCKED SILLY. He falls into a BOWL OF GUACAMOLE. Andy dips his chip in the guacamole, taking Barry with it. ANGLE ON: Ken and Andy. KEN I’ll tell you what. You know what? I predicted global warming. I could feel it getting hotter. At first I thought it was just me. Barry’s POV: Giant human mouth opening. KEN (CONT’D) Wait! Stop! Beeeeeee! ANNA Kill it! Kill it! They all JUMP up from their chairs. Andy looks around for something to use. Ken comes in for the kill with a big TIMBERLAND BOOT on each hand. KEN Stand back. These are winter boots. Vanessa ENTERS, and stops Ken from squashing Barry. VANESSA (grabs Ken’s arm) Wait. Don’t kill him. CLOSE UP: on Barry’s puzzled face. KEN You know I’m allergic to them. This thing could kill me. "Bee Movie" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 32. VANESSA Why does his life have any less value than yours? She takes a GLASS TUMBLER and places it over Barry. KEN Why does his life have any less value than mine? Is that your statement? VANESSA I’m just saying, all life has value. You don’t know what he’s capable of feeling. Barry looks up through the glass and watches this conversation, astounded. Vanessa RIPS Ken’s resume in half and SLIDES it under the glass. KEN (wistful) My brochure. There’s a moment of eye contact as she carries Barry to the window. She opens it and sets him free. VANESSA There you go, little guy. KEN (O.C) I’m not scared of them. But, you know, it’s an allergic thing. ANDY (O.C) * Hey, why don’t you put that on your * resume-brochure? * KEN (O.C) It’s not funny, my whole face could puff up. ANDY (O.C) Make it one of your “Special Skills.” KEN (O.C) You know, knocking someone out is also a special skill. CUT TO: "Bee Movie" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 33. EXT.

VANESSA’S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS Barry hides himself on different PRODUCTS placed along the kitchen shelves. He hides on a Bumblebee Tuna can, and a “Greetings From Coney Island” MUSCLE-MAN POSTCARD on the fridge. BARRY (on fridge) What would I say? (landing on a bottle) I could really get in trouble. He stands looking at Vanessa. BARRY (CONT'D) It’s a bee law. You’re not supposed to talk to a human. I can’t believe I’m doing this. I’ve got to. Oh, I can’t do it! Come on! No, yes, no, do it! I can’t. How should I start it? You like jazz? No, that’s no good. Here she comes. Speak, you fool. As Vanessa walks by, Barry takes a DEEP BREATH. BARRY (CONT’D) (cheerful) Umm...hi.

BARRY Yeah, I am a bee, and you know I’m not supposed to be doing this, but they were all trying to kill me and if it wasn’t for you...I mean, I had to thank you. It’s just the way I was raised. Vanessa intentionally JABS her hand with a FORK. VANESSA Ow! BARRY That was a little weird. VANESSA (to herself) I’m talking to a bee. BARRY Yeah. VANESSA I’m talking to a bee. BARRY Anyway... VANESSA And a bee is talking to me... BARRY I just want you to know that I’m grateful, and I’m going to leave now. VANESSA Wait, wait, wait, wait, how did you learn to do that? BARRY What? "Bee Movie" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 36. VANESSA The talking thing. BARRY Same way you did, I guess. Mama, Dada, honey, you pick it up. VANESSA That’s very funny. BARRY Yeah. Bees are funny.

Ray Liotta Private Select? VANESSA Is he that actor? "Bee Movie" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 52. BARRY I never heard of him. Why is this here? VANESSA For people. We eat it. BARRY Why?

Bees don’t know about this. This is stealing. A lot of stealing! You’ve taken our homes, our schools, our hospitals. This is all we have. And it’s on sale? I’m going to get to the bottom of this.

BACK OF SUPERMARKET LOADING DOCK - LATER THAT DAY Barry disguises himself by blacking out his yellow lines with a MAGIC MARKER and putting on some war paint. He sees Hector, the stock boy, with a knife CUTTING open cardboard boxes filled with honey jars. MAN You almost done? HECTOR Almost. Barry steps in some honey, making a SNAPPING noise. Hector stops and turns. HECTOR (CONT’D) He is here. I sense it. Hector grabs his BOX CUTTER. Barry REACTS, hides himself behind the box again. HECTOR (CONT’D) (talking too loud, to no one in particular) Well, I guess I’ll go home now, and just leave this nice honey out, with no one around. A BEAT. Hector pretends to exit. He takes a couple of steps in place. ANGLE ON: The honey jar. Barry steps out into a moody spotlight. BARRY You’re busted, box boy! HECTOR Ah ha! I knew I heard something. So, you can talk. Barry flies up, stinger out, pushing Hector up against the wall. As Hector backs up, he drops his knife. BARRY Oh, I can talk. And now you’re going to start talking. "Bee Movie" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 54. Where are you getting all the sweet stuff? Who’s your supplier?! HECTOR I don’t know what you’re talking about. I thought we were all friends. The last thing we want to do is upset any of you...bees! Hector grabs a PUSHPIN. Barry fences with his stinger. HECTOR (CONT’D) You’re too late. It’s ours now! BARRY You, sir, have crossed the wrong sword. HECTOR You, sir, are about to be lunch for my iguana, Ignacio! Barry and Hector get into a cross-swords, nose-to-nose confrontation. BARRY Where is the honey coming from? Barry knocks the pushpin out of his hand. Barry puts his stinger up to Hector’s nose. BARRY (CONT'D) Tell me where?! HECTOR (pointing to a truck) Honey Farms. It comes from Honey Farms. ANGLE ON: A Honey Farms truck leaving the parking lot. Barry turns, takes off after the truck through an alley. He follows the truck out onto a busy street, dodging a bus, and several cabs. CABBIE Crazy person! He flies through a metal pipe on the top of a truck. BARRY OOOHHH! "Bee Movie" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 55. BARRY (CONT'D) Barry grabs onto a bicycle messenger’s backpack. The honey farms truck starts to pull away. Barry uses the bungee cord to slingshot himself towards the truck. He lands on the windshield, where the wind plasters him to the glass. He looks up to find himself surrounded by what appear to be DEAD BUGS. He climbs across, working his way around the bodies. BARRY (CONT’D) Oh my. What horrible thing has happened here? Look at these faces. They never knew what hit them. And now they’re on the road to nowhere. A MOSQUITO opens his eyes. MOOSEBLOOD Pssst! Just keep still. BARRY What? You’re not dead? MOOSEBLOOD Do I look dead? Hey man, they will wipe anything that moves. Now, where are you headed? BARRY To Honey Farms. I am onto something huge here. MOOSEBLOOD I’m going to Alaska. Moose blood.

Barry slides toward the end of the wiper, is thrown off, but he grabs the AERIAL and hangs on for dear life. Barry looks across and sees a CRICKET on another vehicle in the exact same predicament. They look at each other and SCREAM in unison. BARRY AND CRICKET Aaaaaaaaaah! ANOTHER BUG grabs onto the aerial, and screams as well. INT. TRUCK CAB - SAME TIME DRIVER You hear something? TRUCKER PASSENGER Like what? DRIVER Like tiny screaming. TRUCKER PASSENGER Turn off the radio. The driver reaches down and PRESSES a button, lowering the aerial. EXT.

It’s a close community. MOOSEBLOOD Not us, man. We’re on our own. Every mosquito is on his own. BARRY But what if you get in trouble? MOOSEBLOOD Trouble? You're a mosquito. You're in trouble! Nobody likes us. They’re just all smacking. People see a mosquito, smack, smack! BARRY At least you’re out in the world. You must meet a lot of girls. MOOSEBLOOD Mosquito girls try to trade up; get with a moth, dragonfly...mosquito girl don’t want no mosquito. A BLOOD MOBILE pulls up alongside. MOOSEBLOOD (CONT'D) Whoa, you have got to be kidding me. Mooseblood’s about to leave the building. So long bee. "Bee Movie" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 59.

FREDDY 90 puffs a minute, semi-automatic. Twice the nicotine, all the tar. They LAUGH again, nefariously. FREDDY (CONT’D) Couple of breaths of this, and it knocks them right out. They make the honey, and we make the money. BARRY “They make the honey, and we make the money?” Barry climbs onto the netting of Freddy’s hat. He climbs up to the brim and looks over the edge. He sees the apiary boxes as Freddy SMOKES them. BARRY (CONT'D) Oh my. As Freddy turns around, Barry jumps into an open apiary box, and into an apartment. HOWARD and FRAN are just coming to from the smoking. BARRY (CONT’D) What’s going on? Are you okay? HOWARD Yeah, it doesn’t last too long. HE COUGHS a few times. BARRY How did you two get here? Do you know you’re in a fake hive with fake walls? HOWARD (pointing to a picture on the wall) "Bee Movie" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 61. Our queen was moved here, we had no choice.

BARRY (CONT'D) What is this? Barry pulls out his camera, and starts snapping. BARRY (CONT’D) Oh no. There’s hundreds of them.

BARRY What right do they have to our hardearned honey? We’re living on two cups a year. They’re putting it in lip balm for no reason what-soever. MARTIN BENSON Even if it’s true, Barry, what could one bee do? BARRY I’m going to sting them where it really hurts. MARTIN BENSON In the face? BARRY No. MARTIN BENSON In the eye?

I don’t eat it! VANESSA We need to talk! "Bee Movie" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 83. She pulls Ken out by his ear. Ken glares at Barry. CUT TO: INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS VANESSA He’s just a little bee. And he happens to be the nicest bee I’ve met in a long time. KEN Long time? What are you talking about? Are there other bugs in your life? VANESSA No, but there are other things bugging me in life. And you’re one of them! KEN Fine! Talking bees, no yogurt night...my nerves are fried from riding on this emotional rollercoaster. VANESSA Goodbye, Ken. KEN Augh! VANESSA Whew! Ken EXITS, then re-enters frame. KEN And for your information, I prefer sugar-free, artificial sweeteners, made by man! He EXITS again. The DOOR SLAMS behind him. VANESSA (to Barry) I’m sorry about all that. Ken RE-ENTERS. "Bee Movie" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 84. KEN I know it’s got an aftertaste! I like it! BARRY (re: Ken) I always felt there was some kind of barrier between Ken and me. (puts his hands in his pockets) I couldn’t overcome it. Oh well. VANESSA Are you going to be okay for the trial tomorrow? BARRY Oh, I believe Mr. Montgomery is about out of ideas. CUT TO: SEQ. 3300 - “ADAM STINGS MONTY” INT. COURTROOM - NEXT DAY ANGLE ON: Medium shot of Montgomery standing at his table. MONTGOMERY We would like to call Mr. Barry Benson Bee to the stand. ADAM (whispering to Vanessa) Now that’s a good idea. (to Barry) You can really see why he’s considered one of the very best lawyers-- Oh. Barry rolls his eyes. He gets up, takes the stand. A juror in a striped shirt APPLAUDS. MR. GAMMIL (whispering) Layton, you’ve got to weave some magic with this jury, or it’s going to be all over. Montgomery is holding a BOOK, “The Secret Life of Bees”. "Bee Movie" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 85. MONTGOMERY (confidently whispering) Oh, don’t worry Mr. Gammil. The only thing I have to do to turn this jury around is to remind them of what they don’t like about bees. (to Gammil) You got the tweezers? Mr. Gammil NODS, and pats his breast pocket. MR. GAMMIL Are you allergic? MONTGOMERY Only to losing, son. Only to losing. Montgomery approaches the stand. MONTGOMERY (CONT’D) Mr. Benson Bee. I’ll ask you what I think we’d all like to know. What exactly is your relationship to that woman? Montgomery points to Vanessa. BARRY We’re friends. MONTGOMERY Good friends? BARRY Yes. MONTGOMERY (softly in Barry’s face) How good? BARRY What? MONTGOMERY Do you live together? BARRY Wait a minute, this isn’t about-- "Bee Movie" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 86. MONTGOMERY Are you her little... (clearing throat) ... bed bug? BARRY (flustered) Hey, that’s not the kind of-- MONTGOMERY I’ve seen a bee documentary or two. Now, from what I understand, doesn’t your Queen give birth to all the bee children in the hive? BARRY Yeah, but-- MONTGOMERY So those aren’t even your real parents! ANGLE ON: Barry’s parents. MARTIN BENSON Oh, Barry. BARRY Yes they are! ADAM Hold me back! Vanessa holds him back with a COFFEE STIRRER. Montgomery points to Barry’s parents. MONTGOMERY You’re an illegitimate bee, aren’t you Benson? ADAM He’s denouncing bees! All the bees in the courtroom start to HUM. They’re agitated. MONTGOMERY And don’t y’all date your cousins? "Bee Movie" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 87. VANESSA (standing, letting go of Adam) Objection! Adam explodes from the table and flies towards Montgomery. ADAM I’m going to pin cushion this guy! Montgomery turns around and positions himself by the judge’s bench. He sticks his butt out. Montgomery winks at his team. BARRY Adam, don’t! It’s what he wants! Adam shoves Barry out of the way. Adam STINGS Montgomery in the butt. The jury REACTS, aghast. MONTGOMERY Ow! I’m hit! Oh, lordy, I am hit! The judge BANGS her gavel. JUDGE Order! Order! Please, Mr. Montgomery. MONTGOMERY The venom! The venom is coursing through my veins! I have been felled by a wing-ed beast of destruction. You see? You can’t treat them like equals. They’re strip-ed savages! Stinging’s the only thing they know! It’s their way! ANGLE ON: Adam, collapsed on the floor. Barry rushes to his side. BARRY Adam, stay with me. ADAM I can’t feel my legs. Montgomery falls on the Bailiff. BAILIFF Take it easy. "Bee Movie" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 88. MONTGOMERY Oh, what angel of mercy will come forward to suck the poison from my heaving buttocks? The JURY recoils. JUDGE Please, I will have order in this court. Order! Order, please! FADE TO: SEQ. 3400 - “ADAM AT HOSPITAL” INT. HOSPITAL - STREET LEVEL ROOM - DAY PRESS PERSON #1 (V.O) The case of the honey bees versus the human race took a pointed turn against the bees yesterday, when one of their legal team stung Layton T. Montgomery. Now here’s Don with the 5-day. A NURSE lets Barry into the room. Barry CARRIES a FLOWER. BARRY Thank you. Barry stands over Adam, in a bed. Barry lays the flower down next to him. The TV is on. BARRY (CONT'D) Hey buddy. ADAM Hey. BARRY Is there much pain? Adam has a BEE-SIZED PAINKILLER HONEY BUTTON near his head that he presses. ADAM (pressing the button) Yeah...I blew the whole case, didn’t I? "Bee Movie" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 89. BARRY Oh, it doesn’t matter. The important thing is you’re alive. You could have died. ADAM I’d be better off dead. Look at me. Adam THROWS the blanket off his lap, revealing a GREEN SANDWICH SWORD STINGER. ADAM (CONT’D) (voice cracking) They got it from the cafeteria, they got it from downstairs. In a tuna sandwich. Look, there’s a little celery still on it. BARRY What was it like to sting someone? ADAM I can’t explain it. It was all adrenaline...and then...ecstasy. Barry looks at Adam. BARRY Alright. ADAM You think that was all a trap? BARRY Of course. I’m sorry. I flew us right into this. What were we thinking? Look at us, we’re just a couple of bugs in this world. ADAM What do you think the humans will do to us if they win? BARRY I don’t know. ADAM I hear they put the roaches in motels. That doesn’t sound so bad. "Bee Movie" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 90. BARRY Adam, they check in, but they don’t check out. Adam GULPS. ADAM Oh my. ANGLE ON: the hospital window. We see THREE PEOPLE smoking outside on the sidewalk. The smoke drifts in. Adam COUGHS. ADAM (CONT’D) Say, could you get a nurse to close that window? BARRY Why? ADAM The smoke. Bees don’t smoke. BARRY Right. Bees don’t smoke. Bees don’t smoke! But some bees are smoking. Adam, that’s it! That’s our case. Adam starts putting his clothes on. ADAM It is? It’s not over? BARRY No. Get up. Get dressed. I’ve got to go somewhere. You get back the court and stall. Stall anyway you can. CUT TO: SEQ. 3500 - “SMOKING GUN” INT. COURTROOM - THE NEXT DAY Adam is folding a piece of paper into a boat. ADAM ...and assuming you’ve done step 29 correctly, you’re ready for the tub. "Bee Movie" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 91. ANGLE ON: The jury, all with paper boats of their own. JURORS Ooh. ANGLE ON: Montgomery frustrated with Gammil, who’s making a boat also. Monty crumples Gammil’s boat, and throws it at him. JUDGE Mr. Flayman? ADAM Yes? Yes, Your Honor? JUDGE Where is the rest of your team? ADAM (fumbling with his swordstinger) Well, your honor, it’s interesting. You know Bees are trained to fly kind of haphazardly and as a result quite often we don’t make very good time. I actually once heard a pretty funny story about a bee-- MONTGOMERY Your Honor, haven’t these ridiculous bugs taken up enough of this court’s valuable time? Montgomery rolls out from behind his table. He’s suspended in a LARGE BABY CHAIR with wheels. MONTGOMERY (CONT'D) How much longer are we going to allow these absurd shenanigans to go on? They have presented no compelling evidence to support their charges against my clients who have all run perfectly legitimate businesses. I move for a complete dismissal of this entire case. JUDGE Mr. Flayman, I am afraid I am going to have to consider Mr. Montgomery’s motion. "Bee Movie" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 92. ADAM But you can’t. We have a terrific case. MONTGOMERY Where is your proof? Where is the evidence? Show me the smoking gun. Barry bursts through the door. BARRY Hold it, your honor. You want a smoking gun? Here is your smoking gun. Vanessa ENTERS, holding a bee smoker Vanessa slams the beekeeper's SMOKER onto the judge’s bench. JUDGE What is that? BARRY It’s a Bee smoker. Montgomery GRABS the smoker. MONTGOMERY What, this? This harmless little contraption? This couldn’t hurt a fly, let alone a bee. He unintentionally points it towards the bee gallery, KNOCKING THEM ALL OUT. The jury GASPS. The press SNAPS pictures of them. BARRY Members of the jury, look at what has happened to bees who have never been asked, "Smoking or Non?" Is this what nature intended for us? To be forcibly addicted to these smoke machines in man-made wooden slat work camps? Living out our lives as honey slaves to the white man? Barry gestures dramatically towards Montgomery's racially mixed table. The BLACK LAWYER slowly moves his chair away. GAMMIL What are we going to do? "Bee Movie" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 93. MONTGOMERY (to Pross) He's playing the species card. Barry lands on the scale of justice, by the judge’s bench. It balances as he lands. BARRY Ladies and gentlemen, please, FreeThese-Bees! ANGLE ON: Jury, chanting "Free the bees". JUDGE The court finds in favor of the bees. The chaos continues. Barry flies over to Vanessa, with his hand up for a “high 5”. BARRY Vanessa, we won! VANESSA Yay! I knew you could do it. Highfive! She high 5’s Barry, sending him crashing to the table. He bounces right back up. VANESSA (CONT'D) Oh, sorry. BARRY Ow!! I’m okay. Vanessa, do you know what this means? All the honey is finally going to belong to the bees. Now we won’t have to work so hard all the time. Montgomery approaches Barry, surrounded by the press. The cameras and microphones go to Montgomery. MONTGOMERY (waving a finger) This is an unholy perversion of the balance of nature, Benson! You’ll regret this. ANGLE ON: Barry’s ‘deer in headlights’ expression, as the press pushes microphones in his face. "Bee Movie" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 94. PRESS PERSON 1 Barry, how much honey do you think is out there? BARRY Alright, alright, one at a time... SARAH Barry, who are you wearing? BARRY Uhhh, my sweater is Ralph Lauren, and I have no pants. The Press follows Barry as he EXITS. ANGLE ON: Adam and Vanessa. ADAM (putting papers away) What if Montgomery’s right? VANESSA What do you mean? ADAM We’ve been living the bee way a long time. 27 million years. DISSOLVE TO: SEQ. 3600 - “HONEY ROUNDUP” EXT. HONEY FARMS APIARY - MONTAGE SARAH (V.O) Congratulations on your victory. What are you going to demand as a settlement? BARRY (V.O) (over montage) First, we’re going to demand a complete shutdown of all bee work camps. Then, we want to get back all the honey that was ours to begin with. Every last drop. We demand an end to the glorification of the bear as anything more than a filthy, smelly, big-headed, bad breath, stink-machine. "Bee Movie" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 95. I believe we’re all aware of what they do in the woods. We will no longer tolerate derogatory beenegative nick-names, unnecessary inclusion of honey in bogus health products, and la-dee-da tea-time human snack garnishments.

They turn the keys simultaneously, War Games-style, shutting down the honey machines. ANGLE ON: the Taffy-Pull machine, Centrifuge, and Krelman all slowly come to a stop. The bees look around, bewildered. WORKER BEE 5 What do we do now? A BEAT. WORKER BEE 6 Cannon ball!! He jumps into a HONEY VAT, doesn’t penetrate the surface.

There are papers everywhere. He’s filling up his cardboard hexagon box. BARRY (out of breath) Adam, you wouldn’t believe how much honey was out there. ADAM Oh yeah? BARRY What’s going on around here? Where is everybody? Are they out celebrating? "Bee Movie" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 100. ADAM (exiting with a cardboard box of belongings) No, they’re just home. They don’t know what to do. BARRY Hmmm. ADAM They’re laying out, they’re sleeping in. I heard your Uncle Carl was on his way to San Antonio with a cricket. BARRY At least we got our honey back. They walk through the empty factory. ADAM Yeah, but sometimes I think, so what if the humans liked our honey? Who wouldn’t? It’s the greatest thing in the world. I was excited to be a part of making it. ANGLE ON: Adam’s desk on it’s side in the hall. ADAM (CONT’D) This was my new desk. This was my new job. I wanted to do it really well. And now...and now I can’t. Adam EXITS. CUT TO: SEQ. 3900 - “WORLD WITHOUT BEES” INT. STAIRWELL Vanessa and Barry are walking up the stairs to the roof. BARRY I don’t understand why they’re not happy. We have so much now.

Vanessa turns Barry around with her two fingers, revealing the view of Central Park, which is also all brown. BARRY Oh no. Oh my. They’re all wilting. VANESSA Doesn’t look very good, does it? BARRY No. VANESSA And who’s fault do you think that is? "Bee Movie" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 102. BARRY Mmmm...you know, I’m going to guess, bees. VANESSA Bees? BARRY Specifically me. I guess I didn’t think that bees not needing to make honey would affect all these other things. VANESSA And it’s not just flowers. Fruits, vegetables...they all need bees. BARRY Well, that’s our whole SAT test right there. VANESSA So, you take away the produce, that affects the entire animal kingdom. And then, of course... BARRY The human species? VANESSA (clearing throat) Ahem! BARRY Oh. So, if there’s no more pollination, it could all just go south here, couldn’t it? VANESSA And I know this is also partly my fault. Barry takes a long SIGH. BARRY How about a suicide pact? VANESSA (not sure if he’s joking) How would we do it? BARRY I’ll sting you, you step on me. "Bee Movie" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 103. VANESSA That just kills you twice. BARRY Right, right. VANESSA Listen Barry. Sorry but I’ve got to get going. She EXITS. BARRY (looking out over the park) Had to open my mouth and talk... (looking back) Vanessa..? Vanessa is gone.

Barry stands on the change box, in front of the driver’s license. BARRY Okay, I made a huge mistake! This is a total disaster, and it’s all my fault! VANESSA Yes, it kind of is. BARRY I’ve ruined the planet. And, I wanted to help with your flower shop. Instead, I’ve made it worse. VANESSA Actually, it’s completely closed down. BARRY Oh, I thought maybe you were remodeling. Nonetheless, I have another idea. And it’s greater than all my previous great ideas combined. VANESSA I don’t want to hear it. Vanessa closes the change box on Barry. BARRY (opening it again) Alright, here’s what I’m thinking. They have the roses, the roses have the pollen. I know every bee, plant, and flower bud in this park. All we’ve got to do is get what they’ve got back here with what we’ve got. VANESSA Bees... BARRY Park... VANESSA Pollen... "Bee Movie" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 106. BARRY Flowers...

Barry is on a laptop calculating flowers, pollen, number of bees, airspeed, etc. He does a “Stomp” dance on the keyboard. BARRY Can you believe how lucky we are? We have just enough pollen to do the job. I think this is going to work, Vanessa. VANESSA It’s got to work. PILOT (V.O) Attention passengers. This is Captain Scott.

As they dosey-do, the toupee of the co-pilot begins to come up, still attached to the front. CO-PILOT (CONT'D) What are you doing? Stop! The toupee comes off the co-pilot’s head, and sticks in the Dustbuster. Barry runs across the bald head. BARRY Wait a minute! I’m an attorney! CO-PILOT Who’s an attorney? PILOT Don’t move. The pilot uses the Dustbuster to try and mash Barry, who is hovering in front of the co-pilot’s nose, and knocks out the co-pilot who falls out of his chair, hitting the life raft release button. The life raft inflates, hitting the pilot, knocking him into a wall and out cold. Barry surveys the situation. BARRY Oh, Barry. CUT TO: INT.

Adam SPRAYS a can of HONEY-WHIP into his mouth. ADAM That’s Barry. BOB BUMBLE ...is now attempting to land a plane, loaded with people, flowers, and an incapacitated flight crew. EVERYONE Flowers?! CUT TO: INT. AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL TOWER BUD Well, we have an electrical storm in the area, and two individuals at the controls of a jumbo jet with absolutely no flight experience. JEANETTE CHUNG Just a minute, Mr. Ditchwater, there’s a honey bee on that plane. BUD Oh, I’m quite familiar with Mr. Benson’s work, and his no-account compadres. Haven’t they done enough damage already? JEANETTE CHUNG But isn’t he your only hope right now? BUD Come on, technically a bee shouldn’t be able to fly at all. CUT TO: INT. COCKPIT. Barry REACTS BUD The wings are too small, their bodies are too big-- "Bee Movie" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 116. BARRY (over PA) Hey, hold on a second. Haven’t we heard this million times? The surface area of the wings, and the body mass doesn’t make sense? JEANETTE CHUNG Get this on the air. CAMERAMAN You got it! CUT TO: INT. BEE TV CONTROL ROOM An engineer throws a switch. BEE ENGINEER Stand by. We’re going live. The “ON AIR” sign illuminates. CUT TO: INT. VARIOUS SHOTS OF NEW HIVE CITY The news report plays on TV. The pollen jocks are sitting around, playing paddle-ball, Wheel-o, and one of them is spinning his helmet on his finger. Buzzwell is in an office cubicle, playing computer solitaire. Barry’s family and Adam watch from their living room. Bees sitting on the street curb turn around to watch the TV. BARRY Mr. Ditchwater, the way we work may be a mystery to you, because making honey takes a lot of bees doing a lot of small jobs. But let me tell you something about a small job. If you do it really well, it makes a big difference. More than we realized. To us, to everyone. That’s why I want to get bees back to doing what we do best. "Bee Movie" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 117. Working together. That’s the bee way. We’re not made of Jello. We get behind a fellow. Black and yellow. CROWD OF BEES Hello! CUT TO: INT. COCKPIT Barry is giving orders to Vanessa. BARRY Left, right, down, hover. VANESSA Hover? BARRY Forget hover. VANESSA You know what? This isn’t so hard. Vanessa pretends to HONK THE HORN. VANESSA (CONT’D) Beep, beep! Beep, beep! A BOLT OF LIGHTNING HITS the plane. The plane takes a sharp dip. VANESSA (CONT’D) Barry, what happened? BARRY (noticing the control panel) Wait a minute. I think we were on autopilot that whole time. VANESSA That may have been helping me. BARRY And now we’re not! VANESSA (V.O.) (folding her arms) Well, then it turns out I cannot fly a plane. "Bee Movie" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 118.

The bees follow Lou Loduca, and EXIT J-Gate. CUT TO: INT. AIRPLANE COCKPIT BARRY Our only chance is if I do what I would do, and you copy me with the wings of the plane! VANESSA You don’t have to yell. BARRY I’m not yelling. We happen to be in a lot of trouble here. VANESSA It’s very hard to concentrate with that panicky tone in your voice. BARRY It’s not a tone. I’m panicking! CUT TO: "Bee Movie" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 119. EXT. JFK AIRPORT ANGLE ON: The bees arriving and massing at the airport. CUT TO: INT.

CUT TO: EXT. AIRPLANE ANGLE ON: The underside of the plane. The pollen jocks have massed all around the underbelly of the plane, and are holding it up. LOU LODUCA Hey Benson, have you got any flowers for a happy occasion in there? CUT TO: INT. COCKPIT Lou, Buzz, Splitz, and Jackson come up alongside the cockpit. BARRY The pollen jocks! VANESSA They do get behind a fellow. BARRY Black and yellow. LOU LODUCA (over headset) Hello. "Bee Movie" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 121. Alright you two, what do you say we drop this tin can on the blacktop? VANESSA What blacktop? Where? I can’t see anything. Can you? BARRY No, nothing. It’s all cloudy. CUT TO: EXT. RUNWAY Adam SHOUTS. ADAM Come on, you’ve got to think bee, Barry. Thinking bee, thinking bee. ANGLE ON: Overhead shot of runway. The bees are in the formation of a flower. In unison they move, causing the flower to FLASH YELLOW AND BLACK. BEES (chanting) Thinking bee, thinking bee. CUT TO: INT. COCKPIT We see through the swirling mist and clouds. A GIANT SHAPE OF A FLOWER is forming in the middle of the runway. BARRY Wait a minute. I think I’m feeling something. VANESSA What? BARRY I don’t know, but it’s strong. And it’s pulling me, like a 27 million year old instinct. Bring the nose of the plane down. "Bee Movie" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 122. LOU LODUCA (CONT'D) EXT. RUNWAY All the bees are on the runway chanting “Thinking Bee”. CUT TO: INT. CONTROL TOWER RICK What in the world is on the tarmac?

AIRPLANE COCKPIT BARRY Good, good, easy now. Land on that flower! Ready boys? Give me full reverse. LOU LODUCA Spin it around! The plane attempts to land on top of an “Aloha Airlines” plane with flowers painted on it. BARRY (V.O) I mean the giant black and yellow pulsating flower made of millions of bees! VANESSA Which flower? BARRY That flower! VANESSA I’m aiming at the flower! The plane goes after a FAT GUY IN A HAWAIIAN SHIRT. BARRY (V.O) That’s a fat guy in a flowered shirt! The other other flower! The big one. He snaps a photo and runs away. BARRY (CONT'D) Full forward. Ready boys? Nose down. Bring your tail up. Rotate around it. VANESSA Oh, this is insane, Barry. BARRY This is the only way I know how to fly. CUT TO: "Bee Movie" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 124. AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL TOWER BUD Am I koo-koo kachoo, or is this plane flying in an insect-like pattern? CUT TO: EXT. RUNWAY BARRY (V.O) Get your nose in there. Don’t be afraid of it. Smell it. Full reverse! Easy, just drop it. Be a part of it. Aim for the center! Now drop it in. Drop it in, woman! The plane HOVERS and MANEUVERS, landing in the center of the giant flower, like a bee. The FLOWERS from the cargo hold spill out onto the runway. INT. AIPLANE CABIN The passengers are motionless for a beat. PASSENGER Come on already! They hear the “ding ding”, and all jump up to grab their luggage out of the overheads. SEQ. 4225 - “RUNWAY SPEECH” EXT. RUNWAY - CONTINUOUS The INFLATABLE SLIDES pop out the side of the plane. The passengers escape. Barry and Vanessa slide down out of the cockpit.

No high five. VANESSA Right. ADAM Barry, it worked. Did you see the giant flower? BARRY What giant flower? Where? Of course I saw the flower! That was genius, man. Genius! ADAM Thank you. BARRY But we’re not done yet. Barry flies up to the wing of the plane, and addresses the bee crowd. BARRY (CONT’D) Listen everyone. This runway is covered with the last pollen from the last flowers available anywhere on Earth. That means this is our last chance. We’re the only ones who make honey, pollinate flowers, and dress like this. If we’re going to survive as a species, this is our moment. So what do you all say? Are we going to be bees, or just Museum of Natural History key chains? BEES We’re bees! KEYCHAIN BEE Keychain! BARRY Then follow me... Except Keychain. BUZZ Hold on Barry. You’ve earned this. Buzz puts a pollen jock jacket and helmet with Barry’s name on it on Barry. "Bee Movie" - JS REVISIONS 8/13/07 126. BARRY I’m a pollen jock! (looking at the jacket. The sleeves are a little long) And it’s a perfect fit. All I’ve got to do are the sleeves. The Pollen Jocks toss Barry a gun. BARRY (CONT’D) Oh yeah! ANGLE ON: Martin and Janet Benson.

BARRY Between you and me, I was dying to get out of that office.
Villager 1: Think it's in there?

Villager 2: All right. Let's get it!

Villager 1: Whoa. Hold on. Do you know what that thing can do to you?

Villager 3: Yeah, it'll grind your bones for it's bread.

Shrek sneaks up behind them and laughs.

SHREK: Yes, well, actually, that would be a giant. Now, ogres, oh they're much worse. They'll make a suit from your freshly peeled skin...

Villagers: No!

SHREK: They'll shave your liver. Squeeze the jelly from your eyes! Actually, it's quite good on toast.

Villager 1: Back! Back, beast! Back! I warn ya! (Waves the torch at Shrek.)

Shrek licks his fingers and extinguishes the torch. The men shrink back away from him. Shrek terrifies the mob with a frightening roar, his spit extinguishing all the remaining torches.

SHREK: (Whispering) This is the part where you run away.

The men drop their torches and pitchforks and flee as fast they can.

SHREK: And stay out! (looks down and picks up a wanted poster. Reads.) "Wanted. Fairytale creatures." (He sighs and drops the paper on the ground.)

THE NEXT DAY - FOREST

Lines of fairy tale creatures are put in chains and are led into wagons by Duloc Guards. The Captain of the Duloc Guards sits at a table paying people for bringing the fairytale creatures in. Waiting in line is Donkey on a leash and his owner. Some of the others in line include Peter Pan, who is carrying Tinkerbell in a cage, Geppetto who is carrying Pinocchio, and a farmer carrying the Three Little Pigs.

GUARD: All right. This one's full. Take it away! Move it along. Come on! Get up!

THE CAPTAIN: Next!

GUARD: (Taking the witch's broom) Give me that! Your flying days are over. (breaks the broom in half)

THE CAPTAIN: That's 20 pieces of silver for the witch. Next!

GUARD: Get up! Come on!

Mama Bear and Papa Bear are locked inside giant cages, with Little Bear in his own cage.

LITTLE BEAR: (crying) This cage is too small.

DONKEY: (To his owner) Please, don't turn me in. I'll never be stubborn again. I can change. Please! Give me another chance!

OLD WOMAN: Oh, shut up. (jerks his rope)

DONKEY: Oh!

THE CAPTAIN: Next! What have you got?

GEPPETTO: This little wooden puppet.

PINOCCHIO: I'm not a puppet. I'm a real boy. (his nose grows)

THE CAPTAIN: Five shillings for the possessed toy. Take it away.

PINOCCHIO: Father, please! Don't let them do this! Help me! (Geppetto takes the money and walks off. The old woman steps up to the table.)

THE CAPTAIN: Next! What have you got?

OLD WOMAN: Well, I've got a talking donkey.

THE CAPTAIN: Right. Well, that's good for ten shillings, if you can prove it.

OLD WOMAN: Oh, go ahead, little fella. (Donkey stays silent).

THE CAPTAIN: Well?..

OLD WOMAN: Oh, oh, he's just...he's just a little nervous. He's really quite a chatterbox. (Smacks Donkey) Talk, you boneheaded dolt, talk!

THE CAPTAIN: That's it. I've heard enough. Guards!

OLD WOMAN: No, no, he talks! He does. (Moving Donkey's lips) I can talk. I love to talk. I'm the talkingest damn thing you ever saw.

THE CAPTAIN: Get her out of my sight.

OLD WOMAN: No, no! I swear! Oh! He can talk!

The guards grab the old woman and she struggles with them. One of her legs flies out and kicks Tinkerbell out of Peter Pan's hands, and her cage drops on Donkey's head. He gets sprinkled with fairy dust and starts floating upwards.

DONKEY: Hey! I can fly!

PETER PAN: He can fly!

THREE LITTLE PIGS: He can fly!

THE CAPTAIN: He can talk?!

DONKEY: Ha, ha! That's right, fool! Now I'm a flying, talking donkey. You might have seen a housefly, maybe even a superfly but I bet you ain't never seen a donkey fly. Ha, ha! (The pixie dust's effects begin to wear off) Uh-oh. (He drops out of the air and hits the ground with a thud.)

THE CAPTAIN: Seize him!

Donkey dodges the guards as they try to grab him and runs deeper into the forest.

GUARDS: He's getting away! Get him! This way! Turn!

Donkey keeps running and he eventually runs head first into Shrek's backside. Shrek turns around to see who bumped into him and glares down at Donkey. Donkey looks scared of Shrek for a moment, but he quickly hides him after seeing that the guards have caught up to him.

THE CAPTAIN: You there. Ogre!

SHREK: Aye?

THE CAPTAIN: By the order of Lord Farquaad, I am authorized to place you both under arrest and...(Shrek slowly approaches the group of guards, the guards visibly frightened by him) transport you to... a designated...resettlement...facility?

SHREK: Oh, really? You and what army? (Smiles)

The Captain looks behind himself and sees that all the other guards have abandoned him. The Captain tucks tail and runs off. Shrek shakes his head and starts walking back to his swamp. Donkey, impressed by Shrek, follows him.

DONKEY: Can I say something to you? Listen, you was really, really, really somethin' back here. Incredible!

SHREK: Are you talkin' to...(he turns around and Donkey is gone) me? (he turns back around and Donkey is right in front of him.) Whoa!

DONKEY: Yes. I was talkin' to you. Can I tell you that you that you was great back there? Man those guards! They thought they was all of that. Then you showed up and bam! They was trippin' over themselves like babes in the woods. That really made me feel good to see that.

SHREK: (Annoyed) Oh, that's great. Really.

DONKEY: Man, it's good to be free.

SHREK: Now, why don't you go celebrate your freedom with your own friends? Hmm?

DONKEY: But, uh, I don't have any friends. And I'm not goin' out there by myself. Hey, wait a minute! I got a great idea! I'll stick with you. You're a mean, green, fightin' machine. Together we'll scare the spit out of anybody that crosses us.

Shrek turns and regards Donkey for a moment before loudly roaring in is face.

DONKEY: Oh, wow! That was really scary. If you don't mind me sayin', if that don't work, your breath certainly will get the job done, 'cause you definitely need some Tic Tacs or something, 'cause you breath stinks! You almost burned the hair outta my nose, just like the time...(Shrek covers his mouth but Donkey continues to talk, so Shrek removes his hand.) ...then I ate some rotten berries. I had strong gases leaking out of my butt that day.

SHREK: Why are you following me?

DONKEY: I'll tell you why. (singing) 'Cause I'm all alone, There's no one here beside me, My problems have all gone, There's no one to deride me, But you gotta have friends...

SHREK: Stop singing! (Picks up Donkey by his ears and tail) It's no wonder you don't have any friends (drops him).

DONKEY: Wow. Only a true friend would be that cruelly honest.

SHREK: Listen, little donkey. Take a look at me. What am I?

DONKEY: (looks all the way up at Shrek) Uh...really tall?

SHREK: No! I'm an ogre! You know, "Grab your torch and pitchforks." Doesn't that bother you?

DONKEY: Nope.

SHREK: Really?

DONKEY: Really, really.

SHREK: Oh.

DONKEY: Man, I like you. What's you name?

SHREK: Uh, Shrek.

DONKEY: Shrek? Well, you know what I like about you, Shrek? You got that kind of "I-don't-care-what-nobody-thinks-of-me" thing. I like that. I respect that, Shrek. You all right. (They come over a hill overlooking Shrek's home.) Whoa! Look at that. Who'd want to live in place like that?

SHREK: That would be my home.

DONKEY: Oh! And it is lovely! Just beautiful. You know you are quite a decorator. It's amazing what you've done with such a modest budget. I like that boulder. That is a nice boulder. (Looks at Shrek's "keep out" signs) I guess you don't entertain much, do you?

SHREK: I like my privacy.

DONKEY: You know, I do too. That's another thing we have in common. Like I hate it when you got somebody in your face. You'retrying to give them a hint, and they won't leave. And there's that big awkward silence you know? (awkward silence) Can I stay with you?

SHREK: Uh, what?

DONKEY: Can I stay with you, please?

SHREK: (sarcastically) Of course!

DONKEY: Really?

SHREK: No.

DONKEY: Please! I don't wanna go back there! You don't know what it's like to be considered a freak. (Donkey pushes Shrek up against the door) Well, maybe you do. But that's why we gotta stick together. You gotta let me stay! Please! Please!

SHREK: Okay! Okay! But one night only.

DONKEY: Ah! Thank you! (he runs inside the hut)

SHREK: What are you...No! (Donkey hops up onto a chair.) No!

DONKEY: This is gonna be fun! We can stay up late, swappin' manly stories, and in the mornin'... I'm makin' waffles.

SHREK: Oh!

DONKEY: Where do, uh, I sleep?

SHREK: (irritated) Outside!

DONKEY: Oh, well, I guess that's cool. I mean, I don't know you, and you don't know me, so I guess outside is best, you know. Here I go. Good night. (Shrek slams the door, shutting Donkey outside) I mean, I do like the outdoors. I'm a donkey. I was born outside. I'll just be sitting by myself outside, I guess, you know. By myself, outside. I'm all alone...there's no one here beside me...

SHREK'S HOME - NIGHT

Shrek is getting ready for dinner. He sits down and lights a candle made out of earwax. He begins to eat when he hears a noise. He stands up with a huff.

SHREK: (to Donkey) I thought I told you to stay outside!

DONKEY: (from the window) I am outside!

Shrek hears a noise from inside and turns to find the source. He sees several shadows moving and looks around, spotting the Three Blind Mice on his table.

MOUSE 1: Well, gents, it's a far cry from the farm, but what choice do we have?

MOUSE 2: It's not home, but it'll do just fine.

GORDON: (bouncing on a slug) What a lovely bed.

SHREK Got ya. (Grabs Gordon, but he escapes and lands on his shoulder.)

GORDON: I found some cheese. (bites into Shrek's ear)

SHREK: Ow! (tries to grab him)

GORDO: Blah! Awful stuff. (jumps down to the table)

BLIND MOUSE: Is that you, Gordon?

GORDO: How did you know?

SHREK: Enough! (he grabs all three mice) What are you doing in my house? (He gets bumped from behind and he drops the mice.) Hey!

Shrek turns around and sees the Seven Dwarves have put Snow White, sleeping in her glass coffin, on the table.

SHREK: Oh, no, no, no. Dead broad off the table!

DWARF: Where are we supposed to put her? The bed's taken.

SHREK: Huh?

Shrek marches over to the bedroom and throws back the curtain. The Big Bad Wolf is sitting in the bed. The wolf just looks at him.

BIG BAD WOLF: What?

Shrek now has the Big Bad Wolf by the collar and is dragging him to the front door.

SHREK: I live in a swamp. I put up signs. I'm a terrifying ogre! What do I have to do get a little privacy?

He opens the front door to throw the Wolf out and he sees that a horde of fairytale creatures have set up camp in his swamp.

SHREK: Oh, no. No! No! (He dodges out the way of a group of witches flying on broomsticks)

The Three Bears (minus Mama Bear) sit around the fire, the Pied Piper is playing his pipe and the rats are all running to him, some elves are directing flight traffic so that the fairies and witches can land...etc.

SHREK: What are you doing in my swamp?!! (this echoes throughout the camp and everyone falls silent.)

Gasps are heard all around. The Three Good Fairies hide inside a tent.

SHREK: All right, get out of here. All of you, move it! Come on! Let's go! Hapaya! Hapaya! Hey! Quickly. Come on! (more dwarves run inside the house) No, no! No, no. Not there! Not there! (they shut the door on him) Oh! (turns to look at Donkey)

DONKEY: Hey, don't look at me. I didn't invite them.

PINOCCHIO: Oh, gosh, no one invited us.

SHREK: What?

PINOCCHIO: We were forced to come here.

SHREK: (flabbergasted) By who?

LITTLE PIG: Lord Farquaad. He huffed and he puffed and he...signed an eviction notice.

SHREK: (heavy sigh) All right. Who knows where this... "Farquaad" guy is?

Everyone looks around at each other but no one answers.

DONKEY: Oh, I do. I know where he is!

SHREK: Does anyone else know where to find him? Anyone at all?

DONKEY: Me! Me!

SHREK: Anyone?

DONKEY: Oh! Oh, pick me! Oh, I know! I know! Me, me!

SHREK: (sigh) Okay, fine. Attention all...fairy tale things. Do not get comfortable. Your welcome is officially worn out. In fact, I'm gonna see this guy Farquaad right now and get you all off my land and back where you came from! (Pause. Then the crowd cheers wildly.) Oh! (to Donkey) You! You're comin' with me.

DONKEY: All right, that's what I like to hear, man. Shrek and Donkey, two stalwart friends, off on a whirlwind big-city adventure. I love it!

DONKEY: (singing) On the road again. Sing it with me, Shrek. I can't wait to get on the road again.

SHREK: What did I say about singing?

DONKEY: Can I whistle?

SHREK: No.

DONKEY: Can I hum it?

SHREK: All right, hum it.

Donkey begins to hum 'On the Road Again'.

DULOC - DUNGEON

A masked man is pouring a glass of milk. Another man is shown walking down the hallway towards the room. As he is let into the room by two guards, we can see that the man is abnormally short. The masked man is dunking a small person into the glass of milk.

FARQUAAD: (stepping forward) That's enough. He's ready to talk.

The Gingerbread Man is pulled out of the milk by Thelonious and is slammed down onto a cookie sheet. Farquaad manically laughs as he walks over to the table. When he reaches the table we see that it only goes up to his eyes. He clears his throat and the table is lowered.

FARQUAAD: (he picks up the Gingy's severed legs and plays with them) Run, run, run, as fast as you can. You can't catch me. I'm the gingerbread man!

GINGY: You're a monster.

FARQUAAD: I'm not the monster here, you are. (throws one leg at Gingy) You and the rest of that fairy tale trash, poisoning my perfect world (crumbes his other leg into dust). Now, tell me! Where are the others?!

GINGY: Eat me! (He spits milk into Farquaad's eye.)

FARQUAAD: I've tried to be fair to you creatures. Now my patience has reached its end! Tell me or I'll...(he grabs one of Gingy's gumdrop buttons)

GINGY: No, no, not the buttons. Not my gumdrop buttons!

FARQUAAD: All right then. Who's hiding them?

GINGY: Okay, I'll tell you. Do you know the muffin man?

FARQUAAD: The muffin man?

GINGERBREAD MAN: The muffin man.

FARQUAAD: Yes, I know the muffin man, who lives on Drury Lane?

GINGERBREAD MAN: Well, she's married to the muffin man.

FARQUAAD: The muffin man?

GINGERBREAD MAN: The muffin man!

FARQUAAD: She's married to the muffin man...(A door opens and the Captain announces himself)

HEAD GUARD: My lord! We've found it.

FARQUAAD: Then what are you waiting for? Bring it in!

More guards enter carrying something that is covered by a sheet. They hang up whatever it is and remove the sheet. It is the Magic Mirror.

GINGERBREAD MAN: (in awe) Ohhhh...

FARQUAAD: Magic mirror...

GINGERBREAD MAN: Don't tell him anything! (Farquaad picks him up and dumps him into a trash can with a lid.) No!

FARQUAAD: Evening. Mirror, mirror on the wall, is this not the most perfect kingdom of them all?

MIRROR: Well, technically you're not a king.

FARQUAAD: Uh, Thelonius. (Thelonius holds up a hand mirror and smashes it with his fist.) You were saying?

MIRROR: What I mean is you're not a king yet. But you can become one. All you have to do is marry a princess.

FARQUAAD: Go on.

MIRROR: (chuckles nervously) So, just sit back and relax, my lord, because it's time for you to meet today's eligible bachelorettes. And here they are!

Using himself as a screen, the Magic Mirror presents a dating show to Farquaad, Thelonious, the Captain, and a few Duloc Guards.

MIRROR: Bachelorette number one is a mentally abused shut-in from a kingdom far, far away. She likes sushi and hot tubbing anytime. Her hobbies include cooking and cleaning for her two evil sisters. Please welcome Cinderella. (shows painting of Cinderella in her ball gown putting on the glass slipper) Bachelorette number two is a cape-wearing girl from the land of fancy. Although she lives with seven other men, she's not easy. Just kiss her dead, frozen lips and find out what a live wire she is. Come on. Give it up for Snow White! (shows painting of Snow White in her slumber) And last, but certainly not last, bachelorette number three is a fiery redhead from a dragon-guarded castle surrounded by hot boiling lava! But don't let that cool you off. She's a loaded pistol who likes piña coladas and getting caught in the rain. Yours for the rescuing, Princess Fiona! (Shows painting of Princess Fiona at the window of her tower) So will it be: bachelorette number one, bachelorette number two or bachelorette number three?

GUARDS: Two! Two! Three! Three! Two! Two! Three!

FARQUAAD: Three? One? Three?

THELONIUS: Three! (holds up 2 fingers) Pick number three, my lord!

FARQUAAD: Okay, okay, uh, number three!

MIRROR: Lord Farquaad, you've chosen Princess Fiona.

"Escape (The Piña Colada Song)" by Rupert Holmes begins playing. The crowd cheers.

FARQUAAD: (Gazing at her portrait) Princess Fiona...she's perfect. All I have to do is just find someone who can go...(Farquaad starts braintstorming)

MIRROR: But I probably should mention the little thing that happens at night.

FARQUAAD: (Talking to himself, ignoring the Mirror) I'll do it.

MIRROR: Yes, but after sunset...

FARQUAAD: Silence! I will make this Princess Fiona my queen, and Duloc will finally have the perfect king! Captain, assemble your finest men. We're going to have a tournament. (smiles evilly)

DULOC KINGDOM - EXTERIOR

Shrek and Donkey come out of the field just outside the Duloc parking lot.

DONKEY: But that's it. That's it right there. That's Duloc. I told ya I'd find it.

SHREK: (Gazing up at Duloc Castle, a building that towers over the rest of the kingdom) So, that must be Lord Farquaad's castle.

DONKEY: Uh-huh. That's the place.

SHREK: Do you think maybe he's compensating for something? (He laughs, but then groans as Donkey doesn't get the joke. He continues walking through the parking lot.)

DONKEY: Hey, wait. Wait up, Shrek.

MAN: Hurry, darling. We're late. Hurry.! (The man and his wife hurry into the entrance)

SHREK: Hey, you! (

A mascot, who is wearing a giant head that looks like Lord Farquaad, screams and begins running through the rows of rope to get to the front gate to get away from Shrek.

SHREK: Wait a second. Look, I'm not gonna eat you. I just- - I just - -

Shrek sighs and then begins walking straight through the rows. The mascot runs into a wall and falls down. Shrek and Donkey look at him then continue on into Duloc.)

DULOC - INTERIOR

They look around but all is quiet and there is not a person in sight

SHREK: It's quiet. Too quiet. Where is everybody?

DONKEY: Hey, look at this!

Donkey runs over and pulls a lever that is attached to a box marked 'Information'. The music winds up and then the box doors open up. There are little wooden people inside and they begin to sing.

WOODEN PEOPLE: Welcome to Duloc such a perfect town / Here we have some rules let us lay them down / Don't make waves, stay in line and we'll get along fine / Duloc is perfect place / Please keep off of the grass / Shine your shoes, wipe your... face / Duloc is, Duloc is / Duloc is perfect place.

Suddenly a camera takes Donkey and Shrek's picture, both of which are dumbfounded.

DONKEY: Wow! Let's do that again! (makes ready to run over and pull the lever again)

SHREK: (grabs Donkey's tail and holds him still) No. No. No, no, no! No.

They hear a trumpet fanfare and head over to the arena.

FARQUAAD: Brave knights. You are the best and brightest in all the land. Today one of you shall prove himself...

As Shrek and Donkey walk down the tunnel to get into the arena Donkey is humming the Duloc theme song.

SHREK: All right. You're going the right way for a smacked bottom.

DONKEY: Sorry about that.

COURTYARD

In the center of a stadium-like courtyard, Duloc Knights are gathered as a large crowd of citizens watches on from the stands. Horses, kegs of beer, arrow targets, and other equipment are scattered about. Farquaad is atop a high up balcony, flanked by two guards, addressing the crowd. Shrek and Donkey step out onto the courtyard but don't seem to be noticed.

FARQUAAD: That champion shall have the honor-- no, no -- the privilege to go forth and rescue the lovely Princess Fiona from the fiery keep of the dragon. If for any reason the winner is unsuccessful, the first runner-up will take his place and so on and so forth. Some of you may die, but it's a sacrifice I am willing to make. (cheers) Let the tournament begin!

Shrek marches through the Duloc Knights, who back away in disgust upon noticing him.

FARQUAAD: (He notices Shrek) Oh! What is that? (The crowd gasps) It's hideous!

SHREK: (Looks at Donkey and then back at Farquaad) Ah, that's not very nice. It's just a donkey (Donkey looks confused, the joke is once again lost on him).

FARQUAAD: Indeed. Knights, new plan! The one who kills the ogre will be named champion! Have it him! (Points at Shrek)

The Duloc Knights draw their weapons and slowly approach Shrek as he backs up, the crowd cheering them on.

CROWD: Get him!

SHREK: Oh, hey! Now come on! Hang on now. (bumps into a table where there are mugs of beer)

CROWD: Go ahead! Get him!

SHREK: (holds up a mug of beer) Can't we just settle this over a pint?

CROWD: Kill the beast!

SHREK: No? All right then. (drinks the ale in one gulp) Come on!

Shrek takes the mug and smashes the spigot off the large barrel of beer behind him. The beer comes rushing out, knocking the knights down and wetting the ground into mud. Shrek slides past the knights and uses a spear like a hockey stick to knock one of his feet. Donkey hops up onto one of the larger beer barrels. It breaks free of it's ropes and begins to roll. Donkey manages to squish two knights into the mud and rolls over another group of knights running after Shrek. Shrek uses the ropes of the wrestling ring to launch himself at two knights and knocks them over. The crowd Shrek jump kicks a knight, and then body slams another. A knight comes from behind Shrek with his spear ready to attack. The crowd gasps, but before he can make a move Shrek puts him in a full-nelson hold.

DONKEY: Hey, Shrek, tag me! Tag me!

Shrek brings the knight over to Donkey, who leans on the ropes and headbutts the knight. Shrek gets up on the ropes and interacts with the crowd, who have now begun to cheer for Shrek and Donkey.

SHREK: Yeah!

A knight tries to sneak up behind Shrek, but he turns in time to sees him and jumps on him.

WOMAN: The chair! Give him the chair!

Shrek uses a folding chair to smack the knight lying on the ground. Shrek dispatches a few more knights with ease. Shrek picks up the last knight, spinning him over his head and then throwing him into the wrestling ring. Donkey kicks his helmet, and the ding sounds the end of the match. Finally all the knights are down. The audience goes wild.

SHREK: Oh, yeah! Ah! Ah! Thank you! Thank you very much! I'm here till Thursday. Try the veal! Ha, ha! (laughs)

Farquaad motions to the guards, who then aim their crossbows at Shrek and Donkey. The crowd gasps and goes silent. Shrek stops laughing.

GUARD: Shall I give the order, sir?

FARQUAAD: No, I have a better idea. People of Duloc, I give you our champion!

The crowd cheers and a fanfare plays.

SHREK: What?

FARQUAAD: Congratulations, ogre. You're won the honor of embarking on a great and noble quest.

SHREK: Quest? I'm already on a quest. A quest to get my swamp back.

FARQUAAD: Your swamp?

SHREK: Yeah, my swamp! Where you dumped those fairy tale creatures!

FARQUAAD: Indeed. All right, ogre. I'll make you a deal. Go on this quest for me, and I'll give you your swamp back.

SHREK: Exactly the way it was?

FARQUAAD: Down to the last slime-covered toadstool.

SHREK: And the squatters?

FARQUAAD: As good as gone.

SHREK: What kind of quest?

DULOC - EXTERIOR

Donkey and Shrek are now walking through the fields heading away from Duloc. Shrek is munching on an onion.

DONKEY: Let me get this straight. You're gonna go fight a dragon and rescue a princess just so Farquaad will give you back a swamp which you only don't have because he filled it full of freaks in the first place. Is that about right?

SHREK: You know, maybe there's a good reason donkeys shouldn't talk.

DONKEY: I don't get it. Why don't you just pull some of that ogre stuff on him? Throttle him, lay siege to his fortress, grinds his bones to make your bread, the whole ogre trip.

SHREK: Oh, I know what. Maybe I could have decapitated an entire village and put their heads on a pike, gotten a knife, cut open their spleen and drink their fluids. Does that sound good to you?

DONKEY: Uh, no, not really, no.

SHREK: For your information, there's a lot more to ogres than people think.

DONKEY: Example?

SHREK: Example? Okay, um, ogres are like onions. (he holds out his onion)

DONKEY: (sniffs the onion) They stink?

SHREK: Yes - - No!

DONKEY: They make you cry?

SHREK: No!

DONKEY: Oh, you leave them in the sun, they get all brown, start sproutin' little white hairs.

SHREK: No! Layers! Onions have layers. Ogres have layers! Onions have layers. You get it? We both have layers. (he throws away the onion and walks off)

DONKEY: (trailing after Shrek) Oh, you both have layers. Oh. {Sniffs} You know, not everybody likes onions. Cake! Everybody loves cakes! Cakes have layers.

SHREK: I don't care... what everyone likes. Ogres are not like cakes.

DONKEY: You know what else everybody likes? Parfaits. Have you ever met a person, you say, "Let's get some parfait," they say, "Hell no, I don't like no parfait"? Parfaits are delicious.

SHREK: (Yelling) No! You dense, irritating, miniature beast of burden! Ogres are like onions! End of story. Bye-bye. See ya later.

DONKEY: Parfaits may be the most delicious thing on the whole damn planet.

SHREK: You know, I think I preferred your humming.

DONKEY: Do you have a tissue or something? I'm making a mess. Just the word parfait makes me start slobbering.

They head off. There is a montage of their journey. Walking through a field at sunset. Sleeping beneath a bright moon. Shrek burns his foot trying to stomp out the campfire, so Donkey pees on the fire to put it out. They arrive at the outskirts of a giant, ominous volcano.

DONKEY: (sniffs) Ohh! Shrek! Did you do that? You gotta warn somebody before you just crack one off. My mouth was open and everything.

SHREK: Believe me, Donkey, if it was me, you'd be dead. (sniffs) It's brimstone. We must be getting close.

DONKEY: Yeah, right, brimstone. Don't be talking about it's the brimstone. I know what I smell. It wasn't no brimstone. It didn't come off no stone neither.

They climb up the side of the volcano.

DRAGON'S KEEP - EXTERIOR

They reach the top of the volcano and gaze out into the crater. An immense, dilapidated castle sits upon a large rock surround by boiling lava in the center of the crater. The only way forward is over a precarious wooden bridge. A single light can be seen in the window of the tallest tower. Thunder strikes and crows circling the castle can be heard. Its all very ominous.

SHREK: Sure, it's big enough, but look at the location. (laughs)

DONKEY: (chuckes along nervously) Uh, Shrek? Uh, remember when you said that ogres have layers?

SHREK: Oh, aye.

DONKEY: Well, I have a bit of a confession to make (Gasps, seeing the skeleton of a horse). Donkeys don't have layers. We wear our fear right out there on our sleeves.

SHREK: Wait a second. Donkeys don't have sleeves.

DONKEY: You know what I mean.

SHREK: Oh you can't tell me you're afraid of heights.

DONKEY: No, I'm just a little uncomfortable about being on a rickety bridge over a boiling like of lava!

SHREK: Come on, Donkey. I'm right here beside ya, okay? For emotional support. We'll just tackle this thing together one little baby step at a time. DONKEY: Really?

SHREK: Really, really.

DONKEY: Okay, that makes me feel so much better.

SHREK: Just keep moving. And don't look down.

DONKEY: (Nervously to himself) Okay, don't look down. Don't look down. Don't look down. Keep on moving. Don't look down. (he steps through a rotting board and ends up looking straight down into the lava) Shrek! I'm lookin' down! Oh, God, I can't do this! Just let me off, please!

SHREK: But you're already halfway.

DONKEY: But I know that half is safe!

SHREK: Okay, fine. I don't have time for this. You go back.

DONKEY: Shrek, no! Wait!

SHREK: Just, Donkey - - Let's have a dance then, shall me? (bounces and sways the bridge)

DONKEY: Don't do that!

SHREK: Oh, I'm sorry. Do what? Oh, this? (bounces the bridge again)

DONKEY: Yes, that!

SHREK: Yes? Yes, do it. Okay. (continues to bounce and sway as he backs Donkey across the bridge)

DONKEY: No, Shrek! No! Stop it!

SHREK: You said do it! I'm doin' it.

DONKEY: I'm gonna die. I'm gonna die. Shrek, I'm gonna die. (steps onto solid ground) Oh!

SHREK: That'll do, Donkey. That'll do. (walks towards the castle)

DONKEY: Cool. So where is this fire-breathing pain-in-the-neck anyway?

SHREK: Inside, waiting for us to rescue her. (chuckles)

DONKEY: I was talkin' about the dragon, Shrek.

DRAGON'S KEEP - INTERIOR

Shrek and Donkey wander through the halls of the castle in search of the princess. The castle is in ruins and not a sound can be heard.

DONKEY: You afraid?

SHREK: No. But...Shh. (Shushes Donkey)

DONKEY: Oh, good. Me neither. (Get spooked and gasps) 'Cause there's nothin' wrong with bein' afraid. Fear's a sensible response to an unfamiliar situation. Unfamiliar dangerous situation, I might add. With a dragon that breathes fire and eats knights and breathes fire. It sure doesn't mean you're a coward if you're a little scared. I sure as heck ain't no coward. I know that.

Donkey crashes into a pile of knight remains, knocking over a skeleton whose helmet lands on Donkey's head. The skeleton head falls off and Donkey gasps.

SHREK: Donkey, two things, okay? Shut ... up. Now go over there and see if you can find any stairs (Grabs the helmet and puts it on).

DONKEY: Stairs? I thought we was lookin' for the princess.

SHREK: (Picking up pieces of armor) The princess will be up the stairs in the highest room in the tallest tower.

DONKEY: What makes you think she'll be there?

SHREK: I read it in a book once. (walks off)

DONKEY: Cool. You handle the dragon. I'll handle the stairs. I'll find those stairs. I'll whip their butt too. Those stairs won't know which way they're goin'.

Donkey wanders off into another room, still talking to himself as he looks around.

DONKEY: I'm gonna take drastic steps. Kick it to the curb. Don't mess with me. I'm the stair master. I've mastered the stairs. I wish I had a step right here. I'd step all over it.

Behind a broken wall, a giant eye opens to see an unaware Donkey. Elsewhere, Shrek spots a light in the window of a tower.

SHREK: Well, at least we know where the princess is, but where's the...

DONKEY: Dragon!

Donkey gasps and takes off running as the dragon roars and breathes fire. The dragon chases after Donkey, stomping on the pile of knight remains in its way.

SHREK: Donkey, look out!

Shrek manages to grab Donkey out of the way just as the dragon breathes fire. The dragon is just about to eat Donkey when Shrek grabs agold of its tail.

SHREK: Got ya!

The dragon begins to swing it's tail back and forth with Shrek still holding on, then launces him into the air. Shrek crashes through the roof of the tallest tower and into Fiona's room. Fiona wakes up and looks at him lying on the floor unconscious.

DONKEY: Oh! Aah! Aah!

The dragon now focuses its attention on Donkey, breathing fire at him and forcing him onto a stone bridge. The dragon knocks down portions of the bridge until Donkey is left staying on a lone pillar.

DONKEY: No. Oh, no, No! (the dragon growls) Oh, what large teeth you have. (the dragon roars) I mean white, sparkling teeth. I know you probably hear this all time from your food, but you must bleach, 'cause that is one dazzling smile you got there. Do I detect a hint of minty freshness?

The dragon appears to be flattered by Donkey's compliments.

DONKEY: And you know what else? You're-- You're a girl dragon! Oh, sure! I mean, of course you're a girl dragon. You're just reeking of feminine beauty. (the dragon begins fluttering her eyes at him) What's the matter with you? You got something in your eye?

Dragon blows a heart-shaped smoke ring at Donkey.

DONKEY: Ohh. Oh. Oh. Man, I'd really love to stay, but you know, I'm, uh...(coughs) I'm an asthmatic, and I don't know if it'd work out if you're gonna blow smoke rings and stuff. Shrek! (She picks him up with her teeth and happily carries him off) No! Shrek! Shrek! Shrek!

FIONA'S TOWER - INTERIOR

Shrek groans as he gets up off the floor, his back to the princess. Fiona, ecstatic to see her knight-in-shining armor, straightens her dress and lays back down on the bed. She then quickly reaches over and gets the bouquet of flowers off the side table. She lays back down and pretends to be asleep. Shrek turns and walks over to her. He bends down over Fiona for a moment and she puckers her lips. Shrek takes her by the shoulders and forcefully shakes her.

FIONA: Oh! Oh!

SHREK: Wake up!

FIONA: What?!

SHREK: Are you Princess Fiona?

FIONA: I am... (smiling) awaiting a knight so bold as to rescue me.

SHREK: Oh, that's nice. Now let's go!

FIONA: But wait, Sir Knight! This be-ith our first meeting. Should it not be a wonderful, romantic moment? (she tosses the bouquet and lays back down)

SHREK: Yeah, sorry, lady. There's no time. (Yanks Fiona out of bed towards the door)

FIONA: Hey, wait. What are you doing? You know, you should sweep me off my feet out yonder window and down a rope onto your valiant steed.

Shrek fiddles with the door lock only for it to snap off.

SHREK: You've had a lot of time to plan this, haven't you?

FIONA: Mm-hmm.

Fiona screams as Shrek suddenly smashes the door down, still holding onto her arm. He rushes down the tower's staircase with Fiona in town and grabs a torch.

FIONA: But we have to savor this moment! You could recite an epic poem for me. A ballad? A sonnet! A limerick? Or something! (pulls her arm away)

DRAGON'S KEEP - INTERIOR

Shrek and Fiona have crossed the lone bridge connecting the tallest tower to the rest of the castle.

SHREK: I don't think so.

FIONA: Can I at least know the name of my champion?

SHREK: Uh, Shrek.

FIONA: Sir Shrek. (clears throat and holds out a handkerchief) I pray that you take this favour as a token of my gratitude.

SHREK: (Consfused) Thanks!

Shrek uses her favour to wipe off his sooty face and hands it back to an appalled Fiona. Suddenly they hear the dragon roar and she drops it to the floor.

FIONA: (Angry) You didn't slay the dragon?!

SHREK: It's on my to-do list. Now come on! (takes off running and drags Fiona behind him.)

FIONA: But this isn't right! You were meant to charge in, sword drawn, banner flying. That's what all the other knights did!

SHREK: Yeah, right before they burst into flame. (gestures at the skeleton of a knight)

FIONA: That's not the point! (Fiona yanks her arm free) Oh! (Shrek looks around and heads for a wooden door.) Wait. Where are you going? The exit's over there.

SHREK: Well, I have to save my ass.

FIONA: Ugh. What kind of knight are you?

SHREK: One of a kind. (opens the door into the throne room)

THRONE ROOM

The floor of the room is littered with a horde of gold coins and jewels. In the center of the room, Dragon has Donkey wrapped up on her tail

DONKEY: Slow down. Slow down, baby, please. I believe it's healthy to get to know someone over a long period of time. Just call me old-fashioned. (laughs worriedly) (we see him up close and from a distance as Shrek sneaks into the room) I don't want to rush into a physical relationship. I'm not ready for a commitment of, uh, this - - Magnitude really is the word I'm looking for. Magnitude-- (Dragon slides her finger over him) Hey, that is unwanted physical contact. Hey, what are you doing? (Dragon looks up to like chandelier above them) Okay, okay. Let's just back up a little and take this one step at a time. We really should get to know each other first as friends or pen pals.

Shrek grabs a chain connected to the chandelier and swings over Dragon. He misses and he swings back again. He looks up and spots that the chandelier is right above the dragons head.

DONKEY: I'm on the road a lot, but I just love receiving cards -- I'd really love to stay, but -- (Dragon tugs at Donkey's tail with her mouth) Don't do that! That's my tail! That's my personal tail. You're gonna tear it off. I don't give permission-- What are you gonna do with that?

Dragon purses her lips and gets ready to kiss Donkey. Shrek starts pulling at the chain until it releases and begins to fall.

DONKEY: Hey, now. No way. No! No! No, no! No. No, no, no. No! Oh!

Shrek lands on Donkey and bumps him out of Dragon's grasp just as she is about to kiss him. Instead the dragon kisses Shrek's butt. She opens her eyes and roars. Shrek lets go of the chain and the chandelier falls onto her head, which forms a collar around her neck. She roars again and Shrek and Donkey take off running. Shrek grabs Donkey in one arm and then grabs Princess Fiona with the other as he runs past her.

DONKEY: Hi, Princess!

FIONA: It talks!

SHREK: Yeah, it's getting him to shut up that's the trick.

They all gasp as they suddenly stop, having reached the end a cliff. Shrek spots a fallen column that has formed a sort of slide. He jumps on it just as Dragon tries to bite them and slides down it. Unfortunately there is a crack in the stone and it hits Shrek right in the groin. His eyes cross and as he reaches the bottom of the slide he stumbles off and walks lightly.

SHREK: Oh!

Dragon chases after them, the chain of the chandelier still unraveling. They are chased by Dragon through a large hall, her chain passing between multiple columns of stone. Dragon ends up in front of them and breathes fire. Shrek dodges the fire and runs away. He comes to a halt.

SHREK: Okay, you two, head for the exit! (setting down Donkey and Fiona) I'll take care of the dragon.

Shrek grabs a sword and throws it down in between several overlapping chain links. The chain links are attached to the chandelier that is still around the Dragon's neck. Shrek runs back to catch up with Donkey and Fiona.

SHREK: Run!

They all take off running for the exit with Dragon close behind. Dragon breathes fire at them but the three outrun it. As they reach the middle of the bridge the fire burns the bridge and it snaps in half. They hang on to the bridge as they are swung to the other side. Donkey, unable to grab on, falls off but Shrek catches him by the tail. Fiona screams in terror as Dragon flies over the boiling lava to get them. Suddenly the chandelier jerks Dragon back, the sword having lodged itself into a stone column and getting the chain stuck. The group quickly climbs up to safety. Dragon looks angrily roars, then gives a sad whimper.

VOLCANO - EXTERIOR

FIONA: (sliding down the volcano hill) You did it! You rescued me! You're amazing. (behind her Donkey falls down the hill) You're - - You're wonderful. You're... (turns and sees Shrek fall down the hill and crashes into Donkey) a little unorthodox I'll admit. But...thy deed is great, and thine heart is pure. I am eternally in your debt. (Donkey clears his throat.) And where would a brave knight be without his noble steed?

DONKEY: I hope you heard that. She called me a noble steed. She think I'm a steed.

Fiona chuckles while Shrek rolls his eyes.

FIONA: The battle is won. You may remove your helmet, good Sir Knight.

SHREK: Uh, no.

FIONA: Why not?

SHREK: I have helmet hair.

FIONA: Please. I would'st look upon the face of my rescuer.

SHREK: No, no, you wouldn't - - 'st.

FIONA: But, how will you kiss me?

SHREK: What? (to Donkey) That wasn't in the job description.

DONKEY: Maybe it's a perk (raises his eyebrows).

FIONA: No, it's destiny. Oh, you must know how it goes. A princess locked in a tower and beset by a dragon is rescued by a brave knight, and then they share true love's first kiss.

DONKEY: Hmm? With Shrek? You think- - Wait. Wait. You think that Shrek is you true love?

FIONA: Well...yes.

Donkey and Shrek stare at each other and then burst out laughing.

DONKEY: (Laughing) You think Shrek is your true love!

FIONA: (Annoyed) What is so funny?

SHREK: Let's just say I'm not your type, okay?

Fiona: Of course, you are. You're my rescuer. Now - - Now remove your helmet.

SHREK: Look. I really don't think this is a good idea.

FIONA: Just take off the helmet.

SHREK: I'm not going to.

FIONA: Take it off.

SHREK: No!

FIONA: Now!

SHREK: Okay! Easy. As you command,,,your Highness. (takes off his helmet)

Fiona looks at him in shock. Shrek awkwardly grins.

FIONA: You...you're...an ogre.

SHREK: Oh, you were expecting Prince Charming.

FIONA: Well, yes, actually. (tries to laugh) Oh, no. This is all wrong. You're not supposed to be an ogre! (walks off)

SHREK: Princess, I was sent to rescue you by Lord Farquaad, okay? He's the one who wants to marry you.

FIONA: Well then why didn't he come rescue me?

SHREK: Good question. You should ask him that when we get there.

FIONA: But I have to be rescued by my true love! Not by some ogre and his-- his pet.

DONKEY: Well, so much for noble steed.

SHREK: Look princess you're not making my job any easier.

FIONA: I'm sorry, but your job is not my problem. You can tell Lord Farquaad that if he wants to rescue me properly, I'll be waiting for him right here. (takes a seat on a nearby rock)

SHREK: Hey! I'm no one's messenger boy, all right? (Gets up in Fiona's face) I'm a delivery boy.

FIONA: You wouldn't dare. Put me down!

Shrek picks Fiona up and slings her over his shoulder like a bag of potatoes.

FIONA: Ah! Put me down!

SHREK: Ya comin', Donkey?

DONKEY: I'm right behind ya.

FIONA: Put me down, or you will suffer the consequences! This is not dignified! Put me down!

WOODS

A little time has passed and Fiona has calmed down. She hangs limply while Shrek carries her with Donkey walking behind them.

DONKEY: Okay, so here's another question. Say there's a woman that digs you, right, but you don't really like her that way. How do you let her down real easy so her feelings aren't hurt, but you don't get burned to a crisp and eaten? How do you do that?

FIONA: You just tell her she's not your true love. Everyone knows what happens when you find your...(Shrek gives her quick shake) Hey! The sooner we get to Duloc the better.

DONKEY: Oh you're gonna love it there, Princess. It's beautiful!

FIONA: And what of my groom-to-be? Lord Farquaad? What's he like?

SHREK: Let me put it this way, princess (drops her on the ground). Men of Farquaad's stature are in,,,,short supply. (he and Donkey laugh)

Shrek washes his face off with the water of a nearby pond.

DONKEY: I don't know. There are those who think...little of him. (they laugh again)

FIONA: Stop it. Stop it, both of you. You're just jealous you can never measure up to a great ruler like Lord Farquaad.

SHREK: Yeah, well, maybe you're right, princess. But I'll let you do the "measuring" when you see him tomorrow.

FIONA: (looks at the setting sun, worried) Tomorrow? It'll take that long? Shouldn't we stop to make camp?

SHREK: No, that'll take longer. We can keep going.

FIONA: But there's....robbers in the woods.

DONKEY: Whoa! Time out, Shrek! Camp is definitely starting to sound good.

SHREK: Hey, come on. I'm scarier than anything we're going to see in this forest.

FIONA: I need to find somewhere to camp now!

Both Donkey and Shrek's ears lower as they shrink away from her.

CLIFFSIDE

Shrek has found a cave that appears to be in good order. He shoves a stone boulder out of the way to reveal the cave.

SHREK: Hey! Over here.

DONKEY: Shrek, we can do better than that. I don't think this is fit for a princess.

FIONA: No, no, it's perfect. It just needs a few homey touches.

SHREK: Homey touches? Like what? (he hears a tearing noise and looks over at Fiona who has torn the bark off of a tree.)

FIONA: A door? Well, gentlemen, I bid thee good night. (goes into the cave and puts the bark door up behind her)

DONKEY: You want me to read you a bedtime story? Cause I will.

FIONA: I said good night!

Shrek looks at Donkey for a second and then goes to move the boulder back in front of the entrance to the cave with Fiona still inside.

DONKEY: Shrek, what are you doing?!

SHREK: (laughs) I just--you know - - Oh, come on. I was just kidding.

CLIFFSIDE - LATER THAT NIGHT

Shrek and Donkey are sitting around a campfire. They are staring up into the sky as Shrek points out certain star constellations to Donkey. SHREK: And, uh, that one, that's Throwback, the only ogre to ever spit over three wheat fields.

DONKEY: Right. Yeah. Hey, can you tell my future from these stars?

SHREK: The stars don't tell the future, Donkey. They tell stories. Look, there's Bloodnut, the Flatulent. You can guess what he's famous for. (chuckles) DONKEY: Alright now I know you're making this up.

SHREK: No, look. (pointing to the stars) There he is, and there's the group of hunters running away from his stench.

DONKEY: That ain't nothin' but a bunch of little dots.

SHREK: You know, Donkey, sometimes things are more than they appear. Hmm? Forget it.

DONKEY: Hey, Shrek, what we gonna do when we get our swamp anyway?

SHREK: Our swamp?

DONKEY: You know, when we're through rescuing the princess.

SHREK: We? Donkey, there's no "we". There's no "our". There's just me and my swamp. And the first thing I'm gonna do is build a ten-foot wall around my land. (turns away from Donkey)

DONKEY: You cut me deep, Shrek. You cut me real deep just now. You know what I think? I think this whole wall thing is just a way to keep somebody out.

SHREK: No, do ya think? (turns away again)

DONKEY: Are you hidin' something?

SHREK: Never mind, Donkey. (lies on his back)

DONKEY: Oh, this is another one of those onion things, isn't it?

SHREK: No, this is one of those drop-it and leave-it alone things!

DONKEY: Why don't you want to talk about it?

SHREK: Why do you want to talk about it? (turns)

DONKEY: Why are you blocking?

SHREK: I'm not blocking. (turns)

DONKEY: Oh, yes, you are.

SHREK: Donkey, I'm warning you.

DONKEY: Who you trying to keep out?

SHREK: Everyone! Okay?!

DONKEY: (pause) Oh, now we're gettin' somewhere. (grins)

At this point Fiona pulls the 'door' away from the entrance to the cave and peaks out. Neither of them see her.

SHREK: Oh! For the love of Pete! (gets up and walks over to the edge of the cliff and sits down)

DONKEY: Hey what's your problem Shrek? What you got against the whole world anyway? Huh?

SHREK: Look, I'm not the one with the problem, okay? It's the world that seems to have a problem with me. People take one look at me and go. "Aah! Help! Run! A big, stupid, ugly ogre!" They judge me before they even know me. That's why I'm better off alone.

It's difficult to see Fiona, but she looks remorseful after hearing Shrek. She closes the door.

DONKEY: You know what? When we met, I didn't think you was just a big, stupid, ugly ogre.

SHREK: Yeah, I know.

DONKEY: So, uh, are there any donkeys up there?

SHREK: Well, there's, um, Gabby, the Small...and Annoying.

DONKEY: Okay, okay, I see it now. The big shiny one, right there. That one there?

SHREK: That's the moon.

DONKEY: Oh, okay.

DULOC - FARQUAAD'S BEDROOM

Farquaad's room is is filled with items prepared for his wedding, including crowns and wedding outfits. Soft music plays in the background. Farquaad is in bed, watching as the Magic Mirror shows him Princess Fiona.

FARQUAAD: Again, show me again. Mirror, mirror, show her to me. Show me the princess. (grinning)

MIRROR: Hmph.

The Mirror rewinds and begins to play again from the beginning, displaying

FARQUAAD: Ah...perfect.

Farquaad looks down and pulls the sheet up to cover himself as the covers rise.

CLIFFSIDE - MORNING

Fiona walks out of the cave. She glances at Shrek and Donkey who are still sleeping. She wanders off into the woods and comes across a blue bird. She begins to sing, and the bird sings along with her. She hits higher and higher notes and the bird struggles to keep up with her. Fiona hits a note so high that it causes the bird to explode. Fiona looks a little sheepish, but she eyes the eggs that the bird left behind. Fiona is now cooking the eggs for breakfast. Shrek and Donkey are still sleeping. Shrek wakes up and looks at Fiona. Donkey's talking in his sleep.

DONKEY: (quietly) Mmm, yeah, you know I like it like that. Come on, baby. I said I like it...

SHREK: Donkey, wake up. (shakes him)

DONKEY: Huh? What?

SHREK: Wake up.

DONKEY: What? (stretches and yawns)

FIONA: Good morning. Uh, how do you like your eggs?

DONKEY: Oh, good morning, Princess!

SHREK: What's all this about?

FIONA: You know, we kind of got off to a bad start yesterday. I wanted to make it up to you. I mean, after all, you did rescue me.

Fiona gets up and sets the eggs down in front of them.

SHREK: Uh, thanks.

Donkey sniffs the eggs and licks his lips.

FIONA: Well, eat up. We've got a big day ahead of us. (smiling, walks off)

SHERWOOD FOREST

The three continue their journey back to Duloc. They are walking through the forest and Shrek belches.

DONKEY: Shrek!

SHREK: What? It's a compliment. Better out than in, I always say. (laughs)

DONKEY: Well, it's no way to behave in front of a princess!

Fiona belches, stopping Shrek and Donkey in their tracks.

FIONA: Thanks.

DONKEY: She's as nasty as you are.

SHREK: (chuckles) You know, you're not exactly what I expected.

FIONA: Well, maybe you shouldn't judge people before you get to know them.

She smiles and then continues walking, singing softly. Suddenly from out of nowhere, a man swings down and swoops Fiona up into a tree.

MONSIEUR HOOD: La liberte! Hey!

SHREK: Princess!

FIONA: Oh! Wait wait--what are you doing?!

MONSIEUR HOOD: Be still, mon cherie, for I am you savior! And I am rescuing you from this green...(kisses up her arm while Fiona pulls back in disgust)...beast.

SHREK: Hey! That's my princess! Go find you own!

MONSIEUR HOOD: Please, monster! Can't you see I'm a little busy here?

FIONA: (getting fed up) Look, pal, I don't know who you think you are!

MONSIEUR HOOD: Oh! Of course! Oh, how rude. Please let me introduce myself. Oh, Merry Men! (laughs)

Suddenly an accordion begins to play and the Merrymen pop out from the bushes. They begin to sing along with Monsieur Hood.

MERRYMEN: Ta, dah, dah, dah, whoo.

MONSIEUR HOOD: I steal from the rich and give to the needy.

MERRYMAN: He takes a wee percentage,

MONSIEUR HOOD: But I'm not greedy. I rescue pretty damsels, man, I'm good.

MERRYMEN: What a guy, Monsieur Hood.

MONSIEUR HOOD: Break it down. I like an honest fight and a saucy little maid...

MERRYMEN: What he's basically saying is he likes to get...

MONSIEUR HOOD: Paid! So...When an ogre in the bush grabs a lady by the tush. That's bad.

MERRYMEN: That's bad. That's bad. That's bad!

MONSIEUR HOOD: When a beauty's with a beast it makes me awfully mad!

MERRYMEN: He's mad, he's really, really mad!

MONSIEUR HOOD: I'll take my blade and ram it through your heart, keep your eyes on me, boys 'cause I'm about to start...

Fiona swings down from the tree limb and kicks Monsieur Hood in the head, knocking him unconscious.

FIONA: Man, that was annoying!

Shrek looks at her in admiration.

MERRYMAN: Oh, you little- - (shoots an arrow at Fiona but she ducks out of the way)

The arrow flies toward Donkey who jumps into Shrek's arms to get out of the way. Fiona demonstrates her martial arts skills and easily beats up every last Merryman. The Merrymen are left on lying on the ground and Fiona walks away.

FIONA: Uh, shall we?

SHREK: Hold the phone. (drops Donkey and begins walking after Fiona) Oh! Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold on now. Where did that come from?

FIONA: What?

SHREK: That! Back there. That was amazing! Where did you learn that?

FIONA: (Blushing) Well...(laughs) when one lives alone, uh, one has to learn these things in case there's a...(gasps and points) there's an arrow in your butt!

SHREK: What? (turns and looks) Oh, would you look at that? (he goes to pull it out but flinches)

FIONA: Oh, no. This is all my fault. I'm so sorry.

DONKEY: Why? What's wrong?

FIONA: Shrek's hurt.

DONKEY: Shrek's hurt! Shrek's hurt?! Oh, no, Shrek's gonna die!

SHREK: Donkey, I'm okay.

DONKEY: You can't do this to me, Shrek. I'm too young for you to die! Keep your legs elevated! Turn your head and cough! Does anyone know the Heimlich?!

FIONA: Donkey! (grabs him by the ear) Calm down! If you want to help Shrek, run into the woods and find me a blue flower with red thorns.

DONKEY: Blue flower, red thorns. Okay, I'm on it. Blue flower, red thorns. Don't die Shrek. If you see a long tunnel, stay away from the light!

SHREK & FIONA: Donkey!

DONKEY: Oh, yeah. Right. Blue flower, red thorns. (runs off)

SHREK: What are the flowers for?

FIONA: (like it's obvious) For getting rid of Donkey.

SHREK: Ah... (grins)

FIONA: Now you hold still, and I'll yank this thing out. (gives the arrow a little pull)

SHREK: (jumps away) Ow! Hey! Easy with the yankin'.

FIONA: I'm sorry, but it has to come out.

SHREK: No, it's tender.

As they continue to talk Fiona keeps going after the arrow and Shrek keeps dodging her hands.

FIONA: Now, hold on.

SHREK: What you're doing is the opposite of help.

FIONA: Don't move.

SHREK: Look, time out. (puts his hand over Fiona's face)

FIONA: Would you...(moves Shrek's hand away) Okay. What do you propose we do?

ELSEWHERE

Donkey is still looking for the special flower.

DONKEY: Blue flower, red thorns. Blue flower, red thorns. Blue flower, red thorns. This would be so much easier if I wasn't color-blind! Blue flower, red thorns.

SHREK: Ow!

DONKEY: Hold on, Shrek! I'm comin'! (rips a flower off a nearby bush that just happens to be a blue flower with red thorns)

THE FOREST PATH

SHREK: Ow! Not good.

FIONA: Okay. Okay. I can nearly see it. (Shrek grunts as she pulls) It's just about...

SHREK: Ow! Ohh!

He rolls over and Fiona lands on top of him. For a moment they stare into each other's eyes.

DONKEY: Ahem.

SHREK: Nothing happened. (throwing Fiona off of him) We were just, uh...

DONKEY: (Teasing) Look, if you wanted to be alone, all you had to do was ask. Okay?

SHREK Oh, come on! That's the last thing on my mind. The princess here was just-- (Fiona pulls the arrow out) Ugh! (he turns to look at Fiona who holds up the arrow with a smile) Ow!

DONKEY: Hey, what's that? (nervous chuckle) That's...is that blood?

Donkey faints. Shrek walks over and picks him up as they continue on their way. There is a montage of scenes as the group heads back to Duloc. Shrek craws up to the top of a tree to make it fall over a small stream so that Fiona won't get wet. After crossing over, Fiona puts her hand along Shrek's back. Shrek then gets up as Donkey is just about to cross. The tree and the tree swings back into it's upright position and Donkey flies off. Shrek swats and a bunch of flies and mosquitoes. Fiona grabs a nearby spiderweb that's on a tree branch and runs through the field swinging it around to catch the bugs. She then hands it to Shrek who begins eating like it's a treat. As he walks off she licks her fingers. Shrek catches a frog and blows it up like a balloon to give to Fiona. Fiona catches a snake, blows into its mouth, fashions it into a balloon animal and presents it to Shrek.

WINDMILL - EXTERIOR

The group arrives at an abandoned windmill on a hill overlooking Duloc.

SHREK: (Dejected)There it is, princess. Your future awaits you.

FIONA: That's Duloc?

DONKEY: Yeah, I know. You know, Shrek thinks Lord Farquaad's compensating for something, which I think means he has a really...(Shrek steps on his hoof)

SHREK: Um, I, uh-- I guess we better move on.

FIONA: Sure. But, Shrek? I'm -- I'm worried about Donkey.

SHREK: What?

FIONA: I mean, look at him. He doesn't look so good.

DONKEY: What are you talking about? I'm fine.

FIONA: (kneels to look him in the eyes) That's what they always say, and then next thing you know, you're on your back. (pause) Dead.

SHREK: You know, she's right. You look awful. Do you want to sit down?

FIONA: Uh, you know, I'll make you some tea.

DONKEY: I didn't want to say nothin', but I got this twinge in my neck, and when I turn my head like this, look, (turns his neck in a very sharp way until his head is completely sideways) Ow! See?

Shrek and Fiona give each happy looks, having made up an excuse to spend more time together.

SHREK: Who's hungry? I'll find us some dinner.

FIONA: I'll get the firewood.

DONKEY: Hey, where you goin'? Oh, man, I can't feel my toes! (looks down and yelps) I don't have any toes! I think I need a hug.

EVENING

Shrek has built a fire and is cooking the rest of dinner while Fiona eats.

FIONA: Mmm. This is good. This is really good. What is this?

SHREK: Uh, weed rat. Rotisserie style.

FIONA: No kidding. Well, this is delicious.

SHREK: Well, they're also great in stews. Now, I don't mean to brag, but I make a mean weed rat stew. (chuckles)

Fiona looks at Duloc and sighs.

FIONA: I guess I'll be dining a little differently tomorrow night.

SHREK: Maybe you can come visit me in the swamp sometime. I'll cook all kind of stuff for you. Swamp toad soup, fish eye tartare -- you name it.

FIONA: (smiles) I'd like that.

They gaze into each other's eyes longingly.

SHREK: Um...princess?

FIONA: Yes...Shrek?

SHREK: I, um, I was wondering...are you...(sighs) Are you gonna eat that?

Shrek points to her last piece of food. Fiona, expecting a different question, removes the weedrat while Shrek is annoyed by the words that couldn't come out. Fiona hands it to Shrek and he grabs onto her hand. The two slowly lean towards each other. Donkey interrupts the moment.

DONKEY: (chuckles) Man, isn't this romantic? Just look at that sunset.

FIONA: (jumps up) Sunset?! Oh, no! I mean, it's late. I-It's very late.

SHREK: What?

DONKEY: Wait a minute. I see what's goin' on here.

Fiona gets worried by what Donkey might say next.

DONKEY: You're afraid of the dark, aren't you?

FIONA: (Relieved) Yes! Yes, that's it. I'm terrified. You know, I'd better go inside. (walks away)

DONKEY: Don't feel bad, Princess. I used to be afraid of the dark, too, until -- Hey, no, wait. I'm still afraid of the dark.

Shrek groans and Fiona chuckles.

FIONA: Good night.

SHREK: Good night.

Fiona goes inside the windmill, gives Shrek a look, and closes the door. Donkey looks at Shrek with a new eye.

DONKEY: Ohh! Now I really see what's goin' on here.

SHREK: Oh, what are you talkin' about?

DONKEY: I don't even wanna hear it. Look, I'm an animal, and I got instincts. And I know you two were diggin' on each other. I could feel it.

SHREK: You're crazy. I'm just bringing her back to Farquaad.

DONKEY: Oh, come on, Shrek. Wake up and smell the pheromones. Just go on in and tell her how you feel.

SHREK: I--there's nothing to tell. Besides, even if I did tell her that, well, you know-- and I'm not sayin' I do, 'cause I don't -- she's a princess, and I'm...

DONKEY: An ogre?

SHREK: Yeah. An ogre.

DONKEY: Hey, where you goin'?

SHREK: To get...more firewood. (sighs)

Donkey looks suspiciously over at the large pile of firewood already piled up. Shrek sits on the hill and gazes out at Duloc until nightfall.

NIGHT

Donkey opens the door to the windmill and walks in. All is quiet and Fiona is nowhere to be seen.

DONKEY: Princess? Princess Fiona? Princess, where are you? Princess?

Fiona looks at Donkey from the shadows, but we can't see her clearly.

DONKEY: It's very spooky in here. I ain't playing no games.

Fiona tries to sneak away but the platform she is walking on breaks. Fiona falls from the railing and lands on a sack of flour. She gets up only but doesn't look like herself. She looks like an ogre and Donkey starts freaking out.

DONKEY: Aah!

FIONA: Oh, no!

DONKEY: No, help!

FIONA: Shh!

DONKEY: Shrek! Shrek! Shrek!

FIONA: No, it's okay. It's okay.

DONKEY: What did you do with the princess?!

FIONA: Donkey, I'm the princess.

DONKEY: Aah!

FIONA: It's me, in this body.

DONKEY: Oh, my God! You ate the princess. (to her stomach) Can you hear me?

FIONA: Donkey!

DONKEY: (still aimed at her stomach) Listen, keep breathing! I'll get you out of there!

FIONA: No!

DONKEY: Shrek! Shrek! Shrek!

FIONA: (Covering Donkey's mouth) Shh.

DONKEY: (Muffled) Shrek!

FIONA: This is me.

Donkey looks into her eyes as she pets his muzzle, and he calms down.

DONKEY: Princess? What happened to you? You're, uh, uh, uh, different.

FIONA: I'm ugly, okay?

DONKEY: Well, yeah! Was it something you ate? 'Cause I told Shrek those rats was a bad idea. You are what you eat, I said. Now--

FIONA: No! I -- I've been this way as long as I can remember.

DONKEY: What do you mean? Look, I ain't never seen you like this before.

FIONA: It only happens when sun goes down. "By night one way, by day another. This shall be the norm... until you find true love's first kiss... and then take love's true form."

DONKEY: Ah, that's beautiful. I didn't know you wrote poetry.

FIONA: It's a spell. (sigh) When I was a little girl, a witch cast a spell on me. Every night I become this. This horrible, ugly beast! I was placed in a tower to await the day my true love would rescue me. That's why I have to marry Lord Farquaad tomorrow before the sun sets and he sees me like this. (begins to cry)

DONKEY: All right, all right. Calm down. Look, it's not that bad. You're not that ugly. Well, I ain't gonna lie. You are ugly. But you only look like this at night. Shrek's ugly 24/7.

FIONA: But Donkey, I'm a princess, and this is not how a princess is meant to look.

DONKEY: Princess, how 'bout if you don't marry Farquaad?

FIONA: I have to. Only my true love's kiss can break the spell.

DONKEY: But, you know, um, you're kind of an orge, and Shrek-- well, you got a lot in common.

FIONA: Shrek?

OUTSIDE

Shrek is walking towards the windmill with a sunflower in his hand.

SHREK: (to himself) Princess, I-- Uh, how's it going, first of all? Good? Um, good for me too. I'm okay. I saw this flower and thought of you because it's pretty and-- well, I don't really like it but I thought you might like it 'cause you're pretty. But I like you anyway. I'd-- uh, uh...(sighs) I'm in trouble. Okay, here we go.

He walks up to the door and pauses outside when he hears Donkey and Fiona talking.

FIONA: I can't just marry whoever I want. Take a good look at me, Donkey. I mean, really, who can ever love a beast so hideous and ugly? "Princess" and "ugly" don't go together. That's why I can't stay here with Shrek.

Shrek steps back in shock, misunderstanding the conversation's meaning.

FIONA: My only chance to live happily ever after is to marry my true love.

Shrek heaves a deep sigh. He throws the flower down and walks away.

INSIDE:

FIONA: Don't you see, Donkey? That's just how it has to be. It's the only way to break the spell.

DONKEY: You at least gotta tell Shrek the truth.

FIONA: No! You can't breathe a word. No one must ever know.

DONKEY: What's the point of being able to talk if you gotta keep secrets?

FIONA: Promise you won't tell. Promise!

DONKEY: All right, all right. I won't tell him. But you should.

Donkey steps outside.

DONKEY: (to himself) I just know before this is over, I'm gonna need a whole lot of serious therapy. Look at my eye twitchin'.

Fiona opens the door and watches him walk away. She looks down and spots the sunflower. She picks it up before going back inside the windmill.

MORNING

Donkey is asleep. Shrek is nowhere to be seen. Fiona is still awake. She is plucking petals from the sunflower.

FIONA: I tell him, I tell him not. I tell him, I tell him not...I tell him! (she quickly runs to the door and goes outside) Shrek! Shrek, there's something I want...

Fiona looks and sees the rising sun, and as the sun crests the sky she turns back into a human. Just as she looks back at the sun she sees Shrek stomping towards her.

FIONA: Shrek! Are you all right? (puts a hand on his shoulder)

SHREK: (shrugs it off) Perfect! Never been better.

FIONA: I --I don't -- There's something I have to tell you.

SHREK: You don't have to tell me anything, princess. I heard enough last night.

FIONA: You heard what I said?

SHREK: Every word.

FIONA: I thought you'd understand.

SHREK: Oh, I understand. Like you said, "Who could love a hideous, ugly beast?"

FIONA: But I thought that wouldn't matter to you.

SHREK: Yeah? Well, it does.

Fiona looks at him in shock, tears welling in her eyes. Shrek looks past her and spots a group approaching.

SHREK: Ah, right on time. Princess, I've brought you a little something.

Shrek gestures towards the group and Fiona stand with her mouth wide, Farquaad has arrived on horseback with an escort of guards. He is also wearing an outfit that disguises his shortness. Donkey wakes up with a yawn as the guards march by.

DONKEY: What'd I miss? What'd I miss? (eyes a guard) (muffled) Who said that? Couldn't have been the donkey. (scurries away)

FARQUAAD: Princess Fiona.

SHREK: As promised. Now hand it over.

FARQUAAD: Very well, ogre. The deed to your swamp, cleared out, as agreed. Take it and go before I change my mind.

Shrek snatches the deed out of the hands of a guard and walks away. Fiona is put off by this exchange.

FARQUAAD: Forgive me, Princess, for startling you, but you startled me, for I have never seen such a radiant beauty before. I am Lord Farquaad.

FIONA: Lord Farquaad? Oh, no, no. (Farquaad snaps his fingers) Forgive me, my lord, for I was just saying a short... (Watches as Farquaad is lifted off his horse and set down in front of her. He comes up to her waist.)...farewell (forcefully smiles).

FARQUAAD: Oh, that is so sweet. You don't have to waste good manners on the ogre. It's not like it has feelings.

FIONA: No, you're right. It doesn't.

Shrek is hurt by the comment. Donkey watches this exchange with a curious look on his face.

FARQUAAD: Princess Fiona, beautiful, fair, flawless Fiona. I ask your hand in marriage. Will you be the perfect bride for the perfect groom?

FIONA: Lord Farquaad, I accept. Nothing would make --

FARQUAAD: (interrupting) Excellent! I'll start the plans, for tomorrow we wed!

FIONA: No!

Shrek suddenly looks back in hopes that Fiona has changed her mind,

FIONA: I mean, uh, why wait? Let's get married today. Before the sun sets.

FARQUAAD: Oh, anxious, are you? You're right. The sooner, the better. There's so much to do! There's the caterer, the cake, the band, the guest list. Captain, round up some guests! There's so much to do!

A guard helps Farquaad back up onto the saddle. Another guard offers Fiona assistance, but she jumps on its back by herself. She looks out at Shrek.

FIONA: (Coldly) Fare-thee-well, ogre.

Farquaad's whole party begins to head back to Duloc. Donkey watches them go.

DONKEY: Shrek, what are you doing? You're letting her get away!

SHREK: Yeah? So what?

DONKEY: Shrek, there's something about her you don't know. Look, I talked to her last night, She's - -

SHREK: I know you talked to her last night. You're great pals, aren't ya? Now, if you two are such good friends, why don't you follow her home?!

Y: Sk, I-- I wanna go with you.

SHREK: I told you, didn't I? You're not coming home with me. I live alone! My swamp! Me! Nobody else! Understand? Nobody! Especially useless, pathetic, annoying, talking donkeys!

DONKEY: But, I thought...

SHREK: Yeah. You know what? You thought wrong! (stomps off)

DONKEY: Shrek.

Montage of different scenes. Shrek arrives back home. The swamp is a mess but the fairytale creatures are gone. Fiona is being fitted for her wedding dress. Shrek throws a sunflower into the fireplace. Farquaad proudly tries on his crown. Fiona stares at her wedding cake, pushing down a figure of Farquaad to show his actual height. She notices a suit of armor that reminds her of Shrek. Donkey stops by a river where he finds Dragon crying, both of them happy to see each other. Shrek and Fiona both try to eat dinner but start crying.

SHREK'S HOME

Shrek is eating dinner when he hears a sound outside. He goes outside to investigate.

SHREK: Donkey? (Donkey ignores him) What are you doing?

DONKEY: (Pushing some wood around) I would think, of all people, you would recognize a wall when you see one.

SHREK: Well, yeah. But the wall's supposed to go around my swamp, not through it.

DONKEY: It is around your half. See that's your half, and this is my half.

SHREK: Oh! Your half. Hmm.

DONKEY: Yes, my half. I helped rescue the princess. I did half the work. I get half the booty. Now hand me that big old rock, the one that looks like your head.

SHREK: Back off!

DONKEY: No, you back off.

SHREK: This is my swamp!

DONKEY: Our swamp.

SHREK: (grabs the tree branch Donkey is working with) Let go, Donkey!

DONKEY: You let go.

SHREK: Stubborn jackass!

DONKEY: Smelly ogre.

SHREK: Fine! (drops the tree branch and walks away)

DONKEY: Hey, hey, come back here. I'm not through with you yet.

SHREK: Well, I'm through with you. (walks off)

DONKEY: (follows him) Uh-uh. You know, with you it's always, "Me, me, me!" Well, guess what! Now it's my turn! So you just shut up and pay attention! You are mean to me. You insult me and you don't appreciate anything that I do! You're always pushing me around or pushing me away.

SHREK: Oh, yeah? Well, if I treated you so bad, how come you came back?

DONKEY: Because that's what friends do! They forgive each other!

SHREK: Oh, yeah. You're right, Donkey. I forgive you... for stabbin' me in the back! (goes into the outhouse and slams the door)

DONKEY: Ohh! You're so wrapped up in layers, onion boy, you're afraid of your own feelings.

SHREK: Go away!

DONKEY: There you are, doing it again just like you did to Fiona. All she ever do was like you, maybe even love you.

SHREK: Love me? She said I was ugly, a hideous creature. I heard the two of you talking.

DONKEY: She wasn't talkin' about you. She was talkin' about, uh, somebody else.

SHREK: (opens the door and comes out) She wasn't talking about me? Well, then who was she talking about?

DONKEY: Uh-uh, no way. I ain't saying anything. You don't wanna listen to me. Right? Right?

SHREK: Donkey!

DONKEY: No!

SHREK: Okay, look. I'm sorry, all right? (sigh) I'm sorry. I guess I am just a big, stupid, ugly ogre. Can you forgive me?

DONKEY: Hey, that's what friends are for, right?

SHREK: Right. Friends?

DONKEY: Friends.

SHREK: So, um, what did Fiona say about me?

DONKEY: What are you asking me for? Why don't you just go ask her?

SHREK: The wedding! We'll never make it in time.

DONKEY: Ha-ha-ha! Never fear, for where, there's a will, there's a way and I have a way. (whistles)

Suddenly Dragon arrives overhead and flies low enough so they can climb on.

SHREK: Donkey?

DONKEY: I guess it's just my animal magnetism. They both laugh.

SHREK: Aw, come here, you. (gives Donkey a noogie)

DONKEY: All right, all right. Don't get all slobbery. No one likes a kiss ass. All right, hop on and hold on tight. I haven't had a chance to install the seat belts yet.

They climb aboard the dragon and she takes off for Duloc.

DULOC CATHEDRAL - INTERIOR

Fiona and Farquaad are standing at the altar. The church is packed with citizens. A man with a prompter card holds up a card that says 'Revered Silence'.

BISHOP: People of Duloc, we gather here today to bear witness to the union....

FIONA: (eyeing the setting sun) Um-

BISHOP: ...of our new king...

FIONA: Excuse me. Could we just skip ahead to the "I do's"?

FARQUAAD: (chuckles and then motions to the bishop to indulge Fiona) Go on.

DULOC CATHEDRAL - EXTERIOR

A large group of guards stand outside the cathedral on watch. Suddenly Dragon lands nearby. The guards all take off running.

DONKEY: (to Dragon) Go ahead, have some fun. If we need you, I'll whistle. How about that? (she nods and goes after the guards) Shrek, wait, wait! Wait a minute! You wanna do this right, don't you?

SHREK: (At the door) What are you talking about?

DONKEY: There's a line you gotta wait for. The preacher's gonna say, "Speak now or forever hold your peace." That's when you say, "I object!"

SHREK: I don't have time for this!

DONKEY: Hey, wait. What are you doing? Listen to me! (pushes Shrek against the door) Look, you love this woman, don't you?

SHREK: Yes.

DONKEY: You wanna hold her?

SHREK: Yes.

DONKEY: Please her?

SHREK: Yes!

DONKEY: (singing James Brown style) Then you got to, got to try a little tenderness. (normal) The chicks love that romantic crap!

SHREK: All right! Cut it out. When does this guy say the line?

DONKEY: We gotta check it out.

INTERIOR

As the bishop talks we see Donkey through one of the windows as Shrek tosses him up so he can see.

BISHOP: And so, by the power vested in me...

EXTERIOR

SHREK: What do you see?

DONKEY: The whole town's in there.

INTERIOR

BISHOP: I now pronounce you husband and wife...

EXTERIOR

DONKEY: They're at the altar.

INTERIOR

PRIEST: ...king and queen.

EXTERIOR

DONKEY: Mother Fletcher! He already said it.

SHREK: Oh, for the love of Pete!

Shrek runs inside without catching Donkey, who hits the ground hard.

INTERIOR

Fiona and Farquaad are leaning in to kiss when Shrek bursts through the doors.

SHREK: (running toward the alter) I object!

FIONA: Shrek?

Fiona initially looks happily surprised to see him, but quickly becomes upset.

FARQUAAD: Oh, now what does he want?

The whole congregation gasps as they see Shrek head towards the altar. They respond positively to him and begin to do "the wave".

SHREK: (to congregation) Hi, everyone. Havin' a good time, are ya? I love Duloc, first of all. Very clean.

FIONA: What are you doing here?

FARQUAAD: Really, it's rude enough being alive when no one wants you, but showing up uninvited to a wedding...

SHREK: Fiona! I need to talk to you.

FIONA: Oh, now you wanna talk? It's a little late for that, so if you'll excuse me--(she leans over to kiss Farquaad)

SHREK: (yanks her away) But you can't marry him.

FIONA: And why not?

SHREK: Because...because he's just marrying you so he can be king.

FARQUAAD: Outrageous! Fiona, don't listen to him.

SHREK: He's not your true love.

FIONA: And what do you know about true love?

SHREK: Well, I--uh--I mean...

FARQUAAD: Oh, this is precious. The ogee has fallen in love with the princess! Oh, good Lord. (laughs)

Farquaad gestures to the man with the prompter card holds up a card that says 'Laugh'. The whole congregation laughs.

FARQUAAD: An ogre and a princess! (laughs)

FIONA: Shrek, is this true?

FARQUAAD: Who cares? It's preposterous! Fiona, my love, we're but a kiss away from our "happily ever after." Now kiss me!

Farquaad puckers his lips and leans toward her, but she pulls back in disgust. She looks towards the window to see the setting sun.

FIONA: "By night one way, by day another." (to Shrek) I wanted to show you before.

Fiona backs up and gives Shrek a sheepish smile. As the sun sets, she changes into her ogre self. The crowd gasps and one person faints.

SHREK: Well, uh, that explains a lot. (Fiona smiles)

FARQUAAD: Ugh! It's disgusting! Guards! Guards! I order you to get that out of my sight now!

A large amount of guards run in and grab ahold of Shrek and Fiona.

FARQUAAD: Get them! Get them both!

FIONA: No, no! Shrek!

Shrek and Fiona try to grab each other's arms but are pulled away from each other. Farquaad grabs ahold of his crown and puts it on.

FARQUAAD: This hocus-pocus alters nothing. This marriage is binding, and that makes me king! See? See?

FIONA: No, let go of me! Shrek!

SHREK: No!

FARQUAAD: Don't just stand there, you morons.

SHREK: (knocking away a guard) Get out of my way! Fiona! Arrgh!

Shrek fights back and knocks out a few of the guards, but they are able to subdue him through sheer numbers

FARQUAAD: I'll make you regret the day we met. I'll see you drawn and quartered! You'll beg for death to save you!

FIONA: No, Shrek!

FARQUAAD: (hold a dagger to Fiona's throat) And as for you, my wife...

SHREK: Fiona!

FARQUAAD: I'll have you locked back in that tower for the rest of your days! I'm king!

Shrek manages to get a hand free and he whistles.

FARQUAAD: I will have order! I will have perfection! I will have (looks up) -- Aaaah!

Donkey and Dragon crash through the windows and Dragon eats Farquaad, swallowing him whole. Most of the guards run away.

DONKEY: All right. Nobody move. I got a dragon here, and I'm not afraid to use it. (Dragon roars.) I'm a donkey on the edge!

Dragon belches and Farquaad's crown flies out of her mouth and falls to the ground.

DONKEY: Celebrity marriages. They never last, do they?

The congregation cheers.

DONKEY: Go ahead, Shrek.

SHREK: Uh, Fiona?

FIONA: Yes, Shrek?

SHREK: I -- I love you.

FIONA: Really?

SHREK: Really, really.

FIONA: (smiles) I love you too.

Shrek and Fiona kiss. Thelonius takes one of the cards and writes 'Awwww' on the back and shows it to the congregation. Suddenly the magic of the spell pulls Fiona away. She's lifted up into the air and she hovers while the magic works around her.

WHISPERS: "Until you find true love's first kiss and then take love's true form. Take love's true form. Take love's true form."

Suddenly Fiona's eyes open wide. She's consumed by the spell and then is slowly lowered to the ground.

SHREK: (going over to her) Fiona? Fiona. Are you all right?

FIONA: (standing up, she's still an ogre) Well, yes. But I don't understand. I'm supposed to be beautiful.

SHREK: But you are beautiful.

They smile at each other.

DONKEY: (chuckles) I was hoping this would be a happy ending.

Shrek and Fiona kiss...and the kiss fades into...

THE SWAMP

...their wedding kiss. Shrek and Fiona are now married. 'I'm a Believer' by Smash Mouth plays in the background. Among the attendees are the fairytale creatures once banished to the swamp, as well as a few Duloc Guards. Shrek and Fiona break apart and run through the crowd to their awaiting carriage. Which is made of a giant onion. Fiona tosses her bouquet which both Cinderella and Snow White try to catch. They end get into a cat fight and Dragon catches the bouquet instead. Donkey looks nervous, but Shrek and Fiona give him reassuring looks. The Gingerbread Man has been mended somewhat and now has one leg and walks with a candy cane cane.

GINGERBREAD MAN: God bless us, every one.

The guests party and dance as Donkey takes over singing the song. Shrek and Fiona ride away in their carriage. Cut to a storybook that reads "And they lived ugly ever after...THE END".

DONKEY: (as he's done singing and we fade to black) Oh, that's funny. Oh. Oh. I can't breathe. I can't breathe.

THE END
